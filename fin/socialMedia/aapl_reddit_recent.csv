35% CAGR Since 2022 - Stock Picking Port,"Back in 2022, bought five companies NVDA, AAPL, COST, GOOG, MSFT - This has returned 35% CAGR, QQQ has returned 17% CAGR in the same time.

80% of SPY's movement comes from 20% of its stocks they say. After looking at so many ETFs, seeing companies do not want like TSLA am back to stock picking a port for the next five years.

NVDA  
MSFT  
GOOG  
META  
AVGO  
BRKB

No Apple, Amazon, or Tesla which are too consumer facing. Have the AI tech behemoths, which are also the true quantum plays. Have insurance companies, contrarian bets, mix of mid cap growth companies which have proven themselves with continuously strong earnings reports, and few crazy growth stories.

**The Rules**: DCA daily, when fear and greed index dumps below 25 then aggressively DCA even lump sum. If a company has more than 2 bad earnings more-so guidance than they're out.

**Good Time To Buy?**: I believe they're all overpriced right now. Will hedge with UVXY calls buying monthlies, selling against the position creating diagonals at various strikes when there's an upcoming binary event which could be negative catalyst.

**Changes This Time**: Am combining timing the market increasing DCA'ing amounts, actively managing based off of ER's/guidance, and hedging against during drawdowns using longer dated uvxy calls. Plan is to hold five years.",2,2025-05-28 02:28:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1kwuttd/35_cagr_since_2022_stock_picking_port/
"Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq trim losses as Trump threatens new tariffs on Apple and EU","U.S. stocks fell Friday and were on track to record a weekly loss as investors assessed the potential impact of President Trump's latest tariff threats and his massive tax bill on the deficit and economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( \^DJI ) fell 0.3 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 ( \^GSPC ) also fell about 0.3 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ( \^IXIC ) was down about 0.6 percent.

Apple Inc (AAPL) must pay a 25 percent tariff on iPhones sold in the U.S. but not made in the U.S., Trump said on Friday, and all three major stock indexes trimmed their losses sharply. The tech giant has begun shifting some of its manufacturing operations to India, while China, home to its main suppliers, is mired in a trade war with the United States. Apple shares fell 3 percent after Trump's tweet on Truth Social.

On Friday afternoon, Trump hinted that the tariffs would apply to other cellphone makers.

Trump told reporters Friday afternoon: ""The tariffs are going to be higher, and Samsung and any company that makes that product is going to be affected, or it's not fair. Again, they don't have tariffs on building factories here. That's why they'll build a factory here.""

Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to raise tariffs on EU imports “right up to 50 percent” as of June 1, as trade talks between China and Europe have stalled.",118,2025-05-24 03:44:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ktsorm/dow_jones_sp_500_and_nasdaq_trim_losses_as_trump/
(05/23) Trump Comments Causing Market Volatility! - Interesting Stocks Today,"AAPL is the most interesting stock today.

[**AAPL (Apple)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)\-President Trump has threatened AAPL with a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S., pressuring the company to shift production domestically. This announcement led to a 3.5% drop in Apple's stock and a broader market sell-off (followed shortly by his comments on Europe). Interested in a short if we break $193 at the open, otherwise more interested in the broad market ETFs. An iPhone made in the US is economically infeasible.

Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader. This is a daily watchlist for short-term trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I am targeting potentially good candidates for short-term trading; I have no opinion on them as investments. The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

News: [Trump Rattles Markets With Fresh Tariff Threats on EU, Apple](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-23/trump-threatens-a-50-tariff-on-eu-goods-starting-in-june)

[**QQQ**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QQQ&p=d)/[**SPY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPY&p=d)/[**VXX**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=VXX&p=d)/[**UPRO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPRO&p=d)\-President Trump recommended a 50% tariff on European Union goods starting June 1, 2025, citing stalled trade negotiations. Interested in if we break $500 level in QQQ/new lows in the market ETFs. Currently long VXX. Here we go again! Escalation of trade tariffs are the main risk here, whether these will be repealed or not, VIX will probably increase over the next few days.

[**BAH (Booz Allen Hamilton Holding)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BAH&p=d)\-BAH reported Q4 adjusted EPS of $1.61, meeting expectations, with revenue of $2.97B vs $3.02B. Provided FY26 guidance below consensus, projecting adjusted EPS of $6.20-$6.55 vs $6.87, and revenue of $12.0-$12.5B vs $12.8B exp. Overall they cited decreased US govt spending as the reason: they're 1/10 firms subject to a federal government “consultant spend review” by cancelling or renegotiating contracts.

[**MSTR (MicroStrategy)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSTR&p=d)\-MSTR hit highs yesterday, driven by the underlying it's based on reaching an ATH. However, the stock and the underlying sold off mainly due to Trump comments. Pretty much moves with the underlying, currently trading at 1.74x multiple to the amount of C it holds. We're in a weird spot where the stock is ""historically"" at  a lower multiplier than usual but essentially near ATH. Possibly interested in a buy if we sell off hard today, otherwise more interested in the market stocks.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.
