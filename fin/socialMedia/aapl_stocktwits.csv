That‚Äôs why I see company leadership as the most important factor when picking a stock‚Äîsomeone who can nourish and nurture it to grow into a baobab tree. I admit it: I‚Äôm insatiably greedy. I want to be a successful investor, dreaming of becoming the Warren Buffett of $BRK.B and I‚Äôm out here searching for my own 10x play. 
 
So I made a decision: if I couldn‚Äôt invest in Steve Jobs at $AAPL or Mark Zuckerberg at $META or Jeff Bezos at Amazon or Elon Musk at $TSLA during their early days‚Ä¶then I‚Äôd go find my version of them today. That one founder with vision, grit, and the guts to build something big. For me, that person is Zhilin Li, CEO of CPHI. Quiet, strategic, and playing the game with integrity‚ÄîI believe she‚Äôs building something the market hasn‚Äôt fully woken up to yet. 
 
With that said. I think. It‚Äôs time to get real.
