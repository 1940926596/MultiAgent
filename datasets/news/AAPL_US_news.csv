2024-08-30T23:56:13+00:00,Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B): Jim Cramer’s Go-To Stock For Success,"We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer’s 10 Go-To Stocks for Success.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) stands against Jim Cramer's other go-to stocks for success.

In a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer offers a perspective on Nvidia and its recent market behavior on Wednesday's episode of Mad Money, presenting a straightforward analysis of the company's stock performance and the broader implications for investors. Cramer notes that owning the company's stock was easier when the company was less well-known. As the company has become a major market focus, it's attracted significant attention and criticism, which is evident after its recent financial report.

""Once you get this big, to the point where you become the focal point of the entire stock market, you're going to have a target on your back. And that's exactly what I think happened tonight to the stock after the firm reported a fine and dandy set of numbers. But fine and dandy is no longer enough for this incredible company.""

Despite reporting impressive numbers—122% revenue growth, a 152% increase in adjusted earnings per share, and a $50 billion buyback— the firm's stock fell after hours. This reaction reflects high expectations that may have become unrealistic. The stock market as a whole suffered due to pre-quarter jitters surrounding the company, with declines in major indices like the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite. The drop in the firm's stock price after the earnings report, coupled with concerns about its influence on the broader market, has led some to call this period the GPU maker's ""buzzkill quarter.""

""The Dow declining 59 points was bad, the S&P losing 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite 1.12%. And now, with the stock sinking after hours, we could be in for a hangover from what they're already calling the company's buzzkill quarter. But the people saying this might as well be having a watch party—yes, there was one—but there's nothing to celebrate here. Move on.""

Cramer emphasizes that the company's role in artificial intelligence is significant, but its overemphasis has become a burden on the market. The company's market capitalization has skyrocketed from around $500 billion to over $3 trillion in just 18 months. Cramer suggests that the company's immense importance might be overblown and that a recalibration might benefit the market.

""We know that artificial intelligence is the way of the future, and it's the best bet on AI. But the company has become an albatross around the market's neck because no one stock should be a proxy for the future of the S&P 500. Yet, that's exactly what's happened as the company has grown from around $500 billion in market cap just 18 months ago to more than $3 trillion now. Maybe after tonight, it will shed that millstone—like Apple did. You know what? That would be a godsend for all of us.""

Story continues

Cramer expresses frustration with how quickly concerns about the company have spread to the broader tech sector, although he acknowledges that companies like Salesforce reported positive numbers. Cramer concludes by advising investors to diversify their portfolios beyond just tech stocks. He suggests that while diversification might seem less exciting, it is a crucial strategy to mitigate risks associated with over-reliance on a single sector or stock.

""It felt like insult added to injury when there was no injury to the company. It will muddle through and recharge at its next iteration. Blackwell goes boring, and we see renewed expectations. I hope they don't get excessive like they were tonight.""

2024-08-30T16:05:49+00:00,Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying,"Nvidia Continues To Lead The Way But Competition Is Intensifying

On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) issued a better-than-expected fiscal second quarter report. However, its shares fell after the report, but still remain about 150% up for the year as Nvidia continues to serve big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA).

Second Quarter Highlights

For the quarter ended in July, Nvidia reported its revenue surged 122% on a YoY basis as it topped $30 billion. After three straight quarters of YoY growth surpassing 200%, revenue of $30.04 billion still surpassed LSEG’s estimate of $28.7 billion. Net income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share while adjusted earnings per share of 68 cents surpassed LSEG’s estimate of 64 cents.

The gross margin did slip to 75.1% from the first quarter’s 78.4%, but it is up compared to last year’s comparable quarter when it amounted to 70.1%.

Data center revenue surged 154% YoY to a record $26.3 billion. Before that business took center stage, Nvidia’s primary focus was gaming that still brought in $2.9 billion as revenue grew 16% YoY. Its professional visualization business reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $454 million while the automotive and robotics brought in revenue of $346 million.

Third Quarter Guidance

For the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, also surpassing StreetAccount’s estimate of $31.7 billion as it expects YoY growth of 80% on the back of strong Hopper demand.

Delay of Blackwell chip rollout.

The full-scale shipment of next-generation Blackwell AI chip is expected in the fourth quarter, bringing in several billion dollars to the revenue table, but analysts were expecting it in the current quarter. Nvidia has made a change to the GPU mask to improve production yield and is now only sending samples to partners and customers. Its H100 and H200, are being used to fuel a majority of generative AI applications, such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT, but CEO Jensen Huang noted that the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible.

Competition is intensifying, but so are Nvidia’s efforts.

Second to Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) on the list of the world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia continues to move fast, like AI and the narrative surrounding it. Its competitors are speeding up their AI efforts with Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta being on track to spend $185 billion on AI before 2024 comes to a close, according to a JPMorgan analysis. Amazon alone focused on advancing its chip development to lower its reliance on Nvidia. During its last earnings call, Amazon also announced the updated versions of its Trainium and Inferentia chips. But even Amazon is still buying chips from Nvidia whose chips still remain a must for most complex AI tasks. Nvidia’s biggest competitor, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) also surpassed earnings estimates with its latest quarter that ended on July 30th. While AMD has had a challenging few years, it is taking active steps to ensure a key spot in the AI field. With key acquisitions to strengthen its AI prospects, AMD is aiming to become a complete provider of AI solutions. Unfortunately for AMD and others, Nvidia is doing everything in its power to make it harder for them to catch up.

Apple is reportedly exploring a significant investment in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, as part of a broader funding round estimated to exceed $100 billion.

Thrive Capital is leading this multibillion-dollar initiative, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal. Specific details about the amount Apple might contribute remain unclear.

This potential investment reflects Apple’s strategy to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities.

Earlier this year, the company announced plans to integrate ChatGPT into Siri, its digital assistant, with the upcoming iOS 18 update. Users will have access to these generative AI features at no additional cost.

Apple's interest in OpenAI marks a shift in its investment approach, as the company has historically been selective about funding startups. Traditionally, Apple has prioritized manufacturing partnerships to secure essential components for its products.

However, the rapid evolution of AI has prompted the company to reconsider its investment strategy.

In conjunction with these discussions, Apple is preparing for an upcoming event where it is expected to introduce its next-generation iPhones. The release is anticipated to showcase new AI tools, further emphasizing Apple’s commitment to innovation in the artificial intelligence space.

2024-08-30T11:11:00+00:00,Want to Buy the Nvidia Dip? Here Are 2 ETFs You Should Take a Look At,"Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the most impressive growth stocks of all time, but it has pulled back by more than 10% from its recent highs. However, with shares trading for more than 38 times sales even after the decline, many investors may not want to buy Nvidia stock individually.

The best way to get exposure to Nvidia in your stock portfolio might be through an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that has a large allocation to the chipmaking giant but also owns plenty of other stocks. Here are two in particular that you might want to take a closer look at right now.

A rising tide lifts all chipmakers

Nvidia is certainly the most prolific chipmaker in the market right now, and for good reason, but it isn't the only one that is benefiting from the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) investment. The Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SOXQ) could be a great way to invest.

For one thing, its 0.19% expense ratio is among the lowest in the semiconductor ETF space and is extremely low for a narrowly focused index fund in general.

This is a rather concentrated ETF with just 30 holdings, all of which are semiconductor manufacturers (chipmakers). As you might expect, large companies make up the bulk of the holdings, but more than one-fifth of the portfolio is small and mid-cap stocks. Nvidia is the highest-weighted holding with a 14% allocation, and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), AMD(NASDAQ: AMD), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Texas Instruments(NASDAQ: TXN) round out the top five.

So, if you want to buy the post-earnings dip in Nvidia, but you're bullish on the chipmaking industry as a whole, this could be an ETF to put on your watch list.

Nvidia isn't the only megacap that has pulled back

Although Nvidia has been in the headlines recently since it is the most recent of the megacaps to report earnings, it's important to realize that it isn't the only ""Magnificent Seven"" stock that has pulled back recently. In fact, with the S&P 500 close to its all-time high, it might surprise you to learn that five out of the seven stocks are down by more than 10% from their 52-week highs.

Company (Symbol) Percent Below 52-Week High Nvidia (NVDA) 10.4% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) 13.7% Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 1% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 2.9% Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) 10.2% Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) 23% Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN) 13%

Data source: yCharts. Percentages as of 8/29/2024.

Now, I'm not saying that these stocks have become ""cheap"" by any definition. All of the Magnificent Seven stocks trade for price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples that are well above that of the average S&P 500 company. But they also have tons of growth potential, and if you're a believer that these winners will keep winning, you can invest in all seven with the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (NASDAQ: MAGS).

Story continues

The ETF offers equal-weight exposure to all seven stocks and comes with a reasonable 0.29% expense ratio. If you think the pullbacks in companies like Alphabet and Amazon.com have been overdone in addition to Nvidia, this ETF could be worth a closer look right now.

Which is best for you?

Both of these are solid ETFs with reasonable fees, and the best choice for you depends on what your investment goals are and what groups of stocks you want exposure to. After Nvidia's latest earnings, if you think the recent pullback has gone a bit too far and want to invest but don't necessarily want to open a large position in Nvidia itself, these two ETFs could be smart choices for your portfolio.

2024-08-30T09:30:00+00:00,"3 Stocks That Have Turned $6,000 Into More Than $1 Million in 20 Years","Investing in promising, up-and-coming growth stocks can lead to significant returns for buy-and-hold investors. You don't need to invest a fortune into a growth stock to make a lot of money -- if you pick the right one -- but it can require a lot of patience.

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG) have each turned four-figure investments into more than $1 million during the course of a couple of decades. Here's a look at how they've done so well, and what a $6,000 investment in these stocks 20 years ago would be worth right now for an investor who had held on.

Apple: $2.5 million

Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone back in 2007 and it has been a monumental game changer for Apple's business ever since. Not only have Apple's loyal customers come back over and over again for new iterations of the device over the years, but it has been the primary hardware foundation upon which a huge and growing ecosystem of services has been built. While iPhone and iPad sales are still the company's bread and butter, it makes an increasing share of revenue from services, and that could continue to be a growth catalyst for years to come.

During the past two decades, Apple has been a phenomenal growth stock to own, turning a $6,000 investment 20 years ago into $2.5 million today. AAPL Revenue (Annual) Chart

Despite its growth into one of the world's most valuable company, Apple's stock still isn't egregiously expensive. It trades at 34 times its trailing earnings, and with AI-capable phones coming soon, there's still reason to remain excited about the company's growth prospects.

Netflix: $1.8 million

Netflix has reconfigured itself several times during the past couple of decades. In the early 2000s, its video rental business was based on mailing physical DVDs to customers. Then it transitioned into streaming and being a curator of content from a wide variety of studios. But as more of those companies have launched their own streaming services, Netflix has pivoted once again to making its own content. Although it still has movies and shows from other entertainment companies, it's not as dependent on them anymore.

And while many other content producers are struggling to make their own streaming services profitable, Netflix has accomplished that. Although consumers may not be thrilled with its subscription price hikes, they have paid off; Netflix's profits have soared at even faster levels than Apple's. NFLX Revenue (Annual) ChartNFLX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.

A $6,000 investment in Netflix 20 years ago would now be worth a staggering $1.8 million. The stock is a bit expensive, trading at more than 42 times trailing earnings. But for a top streaming company, that may be a justifiable premium to pay, especially as it expands deeper into ad-supported plans, which will likely open up even more growth opportunities for Netflix.

Booking Holdings: $1.1 million

Booking Holdings has become one of the largest travel technology companies in the world. Its portfolio includes many popular travel booking sites, including Priceline.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights.com, and others to complement its flagship site, Booking.com.

Demand for travel continues to rise along with population growth, making travel stocks fairly attractive investments to buy and hold, and Booking Holdings is no exception. Although the pandemic put a serious dent in the company's profit, Booking Holdings has bounced back, and its growth prospects remain promising.

2024-08-30T09:30:00+00:00,Power doesn’t always mean profit: What builders of digital ecosystems can learn from the metaverse,"Digitalization marches on, AI continues its rise—and a handful of tech companies are doing very well indeed. The supremacy of these big tech firms increasingly depends on their ability to stand up and manage digital ecosystems with a rich constellation of “complementors”: firms or individual developers collaborating and co-creating to generate something of value for the end customer.

Such ecosystems are set to become more important for more firms, as economies increasingly rely on digital technologies. That’s why a widening range of companies will need to develop ecosystem strategies based on a clear understanding of what makes an ecosystem successful—whether they are “orchestrators” building the ecosystem, or complementors contributing to and transacting within it.

Two recent developments should prompt reflection on the dilemma between openness and control in the design of ecosystems. On the one hand, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg has publicly articulated his vision of, and arguments for, an open AI ecosystem, built around the Llama model family. Albeit in a different domain, this is a striking reversal from Meta’s years-long (and notoriously costly) play for a closed, tightly controlled metaverse. On the other hand, Apple has chosen to enter the metaverse, rebranded as “spatial computing,” with a similar model of strict orchestrator control, built around its VisionPro headset. The spatial computing ecosystem that Apple hopes to foster would give it total control of the hardware and operating system that would enable complementors to sell VR and AR experiences

What is one to make of these conflicting bets? Apple might be attempting to replicate its exceptional success with the iPhone, leveraging its mettle in creating a user-friendly interface to lock in consumers. However, we argue that an orchestrator’s belief that it must create and control everything itself is, more often than not, a cardinal sin of ecosystem design. Indeed, the lessons from Meta’s foray into the metaverse remain valuable, and applicable beyond web3. First: Total openness and absolute dominance pose a false dilemma for ecosystem orchestrators. And second: Complementors have power to shape the trajectory of a viable, scalable ecosystem.

Meta’s bitter lesson

A decade or so ago, it was Facebook that aspired to extend its social media dominance into a new, orchestrator-dominated virtual realm. The company began pouring resources into building an insular ecosystem where it could exercise total control. It developed its own proprietary devices to offer augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, bought headset maker Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, and, as recently as 2021, launched a social VR space called Horizon Worlds. The finishing touch, and a powerful statement of intent, was to rebrand itself as Meta.

The belief that the metaverse had arrived triggered a gold rush, as tech giants like Microsoft and Apple raced to construct their own immersion-focused ecosystems. But fast-forward a few years and reality has fallen far short of the hype. By 2023, two years after its launch, Meta’s Horizon Worlds had fewer than 200,000 monthly active users, and only 9% of its worlds had been visited by more than 50 people. Meanwhile, U.S. sales of VR headsets and AR glasses crashed, plummeting nearly 40% to $664 million in 2023. That understandably dismayed content creators who were paying fees of up to 47.5% to sell their virtual goods on the platform, shrinking the incentive for these complementors to invest in creating added-value content.

Humbled, Meta belatedly acknowledged that collaboration might ultimately be a better course; it opened up the operating system that powers its line of MetaQuest VR devicesearlier this year. This shift enabled third-party hardware makers to build mixed reality (MR) experiences. Meta also allowed “pre-approved” partners to develop specific use cases: hardware manufacturer Asus would develop a gaming headset under its Republic of Gamers brand, while Lenovo developed MR devices for productivity, learning, and entertainment. In 2022, Meta struck a partnership with Microsoft to bring the immersive tools of Mesh for Microsoft Teams to MetaQuest devices.

Meta’s current approach represents a middle ground between open and closed ecosystems and has allowed it to entice complementors while still controlling who can use its operating system and (to some extent) what for.

Models of ecosystem-building

Meta’s change of heart shows that there’s more than one way for orchestrators to attract and benefit from complementors in their ecosystems. Meta first aspired to a “hardware lock,” where users are locked into proprietary devices, but third parties can create content for them. Microsoft, meanwhile, aimed even higher with its own metaverse play: a “total lock,” where both hardware and software are under the orchestrator’s control.

Apple’s strategy is somewhere in between: A hardware lock, with selective and limited opening for complementors. Other companies are exploring different paths: Blockchain game developer Axie pursued a “content lock” where it controlled content creation, but was device-agnostic; and Decentraland, a truly “open platform,” is not only device-agnostic but actively encourages content creation by multiple third parties.

Drawing on our recent research project on the metaverse, we looked at the approaches different orchestrators took, and found that, as a rule, firms that tried to control too much were unable to generate complementor support and ultimately failed. It makes sense then that we’re seeing a broader trend of orchestrators giving up on this “orchestrator takes all” approach and embracing partnerships that instead multiply use cases and drive user adoption.

Only time will tell whether Apple’s gamble on the sort of hardware-lock, high-fee, and tightly- controlled-content strategy that Meta abandoned will pay off. But for now, it is predictably struggling to entice participation. None of YouTube, Spotify, or Netflix currently offers a dedicated app for Apple’s Vision Pro headset. In fact, 46 of the most popular apps on Apple’s App Store weren’t available on Vision Pro’s launch day. These complementors are tight-lipped on why they’re staying away, but their reluctance is already having an impact, undermining the appeal of Apple’s high-quality user hardware and user experience, and reportedly prompting Apple to cut production targets for the Vision Pro.

Lessons for ecosystem participants

Even though Big Tech giants may be tempted to leverage their extraordinary power to impose their will onto a new ecosystem, this not only thwarts complementors—it can often endanger ecosystem success. An effective ecosystem strategy does not always benefit from hardball tactics, as Meta’s own evolution shows. Through its strategic pivot, Meta now hopes to address the two biggest drawbacks to extended reality: sluggish hardware development and clunky experiences that few users enjoy. To do that the company is now betting on the future of an interconnected, interoperable metaverse, and gunning for first-mover advantage when it comes to setting standards for transferable digital identities. And these lessons are now being carried over into Meta’s play in the generative AI space as well.

Opening up the ecosystem means making the social layer within the Horizon OS that powers its Horizon Worlds more appealing to users by allowing profiles to glide seamlessly between virtual spaces, giving them ownership of their virtual identities. Meta’s calculation is that if Horizon OS becomes the engine of users’ social experiences everywhere, the company can harvest customer data and strengthen its existing market position in digital advertising.

Ecosystem complementors, that is, the partners who are struggling to compete in a world of tech giants, still have power to influence the ecosystems in which they operate—most importantly, by refusing to do so. For complementors, strategic alignment can substitute for tech power, and clever positioning can make a difference.

In the new growth area of GenAI-enabled ecosystems, getting the ecosystem strategy right will be crucial for complementors and orchestrators alike. As we’ve argued before, the locus of innovation and investment will overtime move downstream, towards small, domain-specific models that numerous companies will be best positioned to develop “on top” of the foundation models created by leading GenAI startups and hyperscalers.

***

The metaverse itself is far from dead. In fact, the spatial computing race has only just begun. Which ecosystem-building strategy will prevail: Meta with its new semi-open strategy, or Apple and its “total lock” hardware approach? Or will it be another orchestrator that already dominates the metaverse, like the online game platform Roblox, with 60 million daily active users? One thing is for certain: Orchestrators will have to become much more sophisticated and nuanced in how they run their ecosystems—whether in the virtual world or the real one.

2024-08-30T09:02:00+00:00,Forget Nvidia: Billionaire Daniel Loeb Has 31% of His $8.7 Billion Portfolio in Just 4 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead,"There's little question that one of the driving forces behind the ongoing bull market is the accelerating adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), and the poster child for that shifting paradigm is Nvidia. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) provide the computational horsepower needed for AI and have quickly become the gold standard. As a result, Nvidia continues to deliver quarter after quarter of record-setting results, which has sent its stock price soaring.

However, some investors are concerned that growing competition and the stock's lofty valuation make Nvidia increasingly risky. Consequently, these same investors are looking for other ways to profit from the AI revolution. One place to look for other ideas is among the holdings of successful hedge fund managers.

One such money manager is Daniel Loeb. The billionaire heads up Third Point, the hedge fund he founded in 1995. Loeb turned seed money of just $3.4 billion -- raised from family and friends -- into a financial empire with assets under management of $12 billion.

Loeb has left no doubt about the potential implications of AI, calling it ""transformational"" and ultimately sparking a ""profound economic upheaval."" In fact, the famed investor is so bullish about AI that it's the ""key element of the thesis for nearly half"" the hedge funds stock holdings. Just four stocks make up his largest AI investments. Image source: Getty Images.

Artificial intelligence stock No. 1: Amazon -- 11.4% of holdings

Third Point's largest AI holding -- and largest position overall -- is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a stock that he has held continuously since 2019. He notes that AI favors incumbents like Amazon ""who are deploying their financial and intellectual war chests to win the AI arms race.""

He's clearly done his homework. Amazon quickly positioned itself to capitalize on the AI opportunity, offering a roster of the most in-demand AI models to its cloud customers, while also creating its own, but that's just the beginning. Amazon is using AI to identify and store inventory 75% more quickly while bringing down order processing times by 25%, giving its legacy online retail business a boost. The company also uses AI to better address the target audience for its digital ads.

Loeb's Amazon position remained unchanged in the second quarter, with a total stake of 5.1 million shares worth about $986 million and nearly 11% of Third Point's portfolio. And at less than 3 times forward sales, Amazon is an attractively priced way to play the AI revolution.

Story continues

As a longtime Amazon shareholder, I'm completely on board with Loeb. Not only is Amazon the leading provider of e-commerce and cloud computing, but it's also a growing power player in digital advertising. Adding AI into the mix gives Amazon another way to win when the odds are already stacked in its favor.

Artificial intelligence stock No. 2: Microsoft -- 8.1% of holdings

Third Point's second-largest AI holding and third-largest overall is Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). Loeb views the software giant as one of the ""best-run legacy"" companies, which has ""built enormous competitive advantages"" and is well positioned to benefit from the adoption of AI.

His logic is irrefutable. Like Amazon, Microsoft offers a wealth of AI models to cloud customers. However, the company's biggest AI opportunity is likely Copilot, Microsoft's suite of AI-powered digital assistants. Designed for a variety of industries and tasks, Copilot can streamline tasks and automate time-consuming chores, thereby increasing productivity. Demand for Copilot has been robust and has also helped boost the adoption of its cloud services. Microsoft's noted in the calendar second quarter that eight points of Azure Cloud's growth were the result of AI services.

Third Point trimmed its Microsoft position by about 11% in the second quarter, likely to expand its exposure to other AI stocks (more on that shortly).

Microsoft stock is selling for a premium at 38 times earnings. However, the company's strong legacy businesses and early positioning in AI show it's deserving of a premium.

I'm a firm believer that Microsoft has a long runway ahead. Generative AI will continue to evolve and Copilot is an early mover in the space. When added to the company's existing businesses, AI gives Microsoft an extraordinary competitive advantage -- which is why I own the stock.

Artificial intelligence stock No. 3: Meta Platforms -- 6.4% of holdings

Loeb's third largest AI holding and fourth overall is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Loeb hasn't been as vocal about his position in the tech giant but is likely bullish on the recovery in digital advertising, as targeted ads on its social media platforms generate 98% of its revenue. However, Meta also made a surprising move to capitalize on AI, which likely also informed Loeb's decision.

Meta moved into AI contention by quickly developing its Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMA), an AI model that is carried by all the major cloud platforms for a fee. This AI system is fueled by a treasure trove of data from the billions of users on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Messenger. AI is a new revenue stream for Meta, so we don't yet know how lucrative it might ultimately be.

Third Point's stake in Meta amounts to 1.1 million shares worth roughly $555 million. Similar to Microsoft, Loeb trimmed his position in the second quarter by about 11%, likely to spread his AI bets (more on this below).

The stock currently sells for less than 27 times earnings, a discount compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC).

I'm equally bullish on Meta Platforms. I think the company's move to leverage its user data to create AI models was nothing short of brilliant. Add to that Meta's ever-expanding advertising prowess and you have the recipe for long-term success.

Artificial intelligence stock No. 4: Apple -- 4.7% of holdings

There was a notable addition to Third Point's portfolio last quarter, that of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Loeb loaded up, acquiring nearly 2 million shares of the iPhone maker in a stake valued at roughly $411 million and representing nearly 5% of his portfolio.

Loeb noted that while some investors fear Apple may ""be an AI loser,"" he takes a different view. He cited the company's 2.2 billion devices and wide selection of electronic devices as an advantage and believes "" AI-related demand could drive a step-change improvement in Apple's revenue and earnings over the next few years."" He further suggests that the company's recently announced Apple Intelligence -- a suite of AI-powered smartphone features -- will drive ""meaningful demand"" from Apple's installed base.

Investor sentiment has weighed on Apple stock since early last year, as some fear that AI had left the company behind, but I think that view is myopic. Apple has a long history of taking the time to put its unique stamp on its products and services, which has helped make it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Investors who dismiss Apple do so at their own peril.

The biggest opportunity?

I own all four of these AI-centric stocks and believe they're all worth owning, but two stand out, albeit for different reasons.

Since generative AI kicked off in earnest early last year, Apple stock has gained just 62%, the lowest among our quartet of stocks. Investors are waiting to see what the iPhone maker will unveils during its next product update on September 9. This could be the catalyst Apple needs to send its shares higher.

Strictly from a valuation perspective, Meta Platforms remains the most attractively priced, at less than 26 times earnings, compared to a multiple of 29 for the S&P 500.

That said, each of these stocks represents a compelling opportunity in the AI revolution.

2024-08-30T08:51:00+00:00,Here's Why Nvidia's New $50 Billion Buyback May Bolster the Bear Case for the Stock,"Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) fiscal second-quarter earnings report is out, and it appears the chipmaker is raking in massive sums of cash. Revenue for the period was $30 billion, up 122% year over year. Even more, earnings per share soared 168% to $0.67. Further, free cash flow for the quarter was about $13.5 billion, up from approximately $6.0 billion in the year-ago period.

""NVIDIA achieved record revenues as global data centers are in full throttle to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI,"" said Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang in the company's quarterly report.

All of this is great. But in the context of Nvidia's nearly $3 trillion market capitalization, it's not as impressive. Herein lies the problem with Nvidia stock: The valuation may simply be a bit ahead of itself. One telling way to further highlight this is by taking a look at the company's share repurchase program and viewing it next to its massive market cap.

Everything is relative

Nvidia repurchased $15.4 billion worth of its shares over the last two quarters. This would leave $7.5 billion of authorized cash for further repurchases, except the company just announced that its board of directors authorized an additional $50 billion for repurchases.

Sure, $50 billion is a huge sum. But it's a bit small in the context of Nvidia's approximately $3 trillion market cap. Even when you add in the $7.5 billion it still has from its previous program, total outstanding cash authorized for repurchases amounts to less than 2% of Nvidia's market cap.

Compare this to the $60 billion authorization Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) announced when it got serious about share repurchases in 2013. This amounted to nearly 16% of the company's shares outstanding at the time. Fast forward to Apple's first full quarter following this authorization and the company spent $11 billion buying back its stock. And what was Apple's market cap at the time? Around $400 billion. In contrast, Nvidia spent just about $7.2 billion in its most recent quarter repurchasing shares even though the company's market capitalization amounts to about $3 trillion today.

In one final comparison with Apple, Nvidia's cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities currently total $34.8 billion, or just over 1% of the company's market capitalization; yet Apple's cash at the time it got serious about repurchases was $147 billion, or more than a third of its market capitalization.

In short, Nvidia's underwhelming repurchase program (and cash balance to support it) relative to its market capitalization arguably draws attention to the fact that its valuation may be a bit inflated.

Story continues

Questionable timing

The other issue with Nvidia's repurchase program is the timing. With shares trading at around 55 times earnings, the stock may have already priced in the continued upside for this cyclical business. Repurchasing shares at a potentially fair or overvalued price isn't always in the best interest of shareholders. It may be better for Nvidia to hold onto cash and buy back its stock if it were available for a better price -- a price that looks like a clear discount to a conservative estimate of the stock's intrinsic value.

Of course, Nvidia's business performance is worth applauding. It's incredible how the company has innovated and executed to capitalize on the demand for AI-fueled products and services. Further, the company's growth rate and profitability is astounding. Still, none of this addresses the key concern investors should have: Valuation.

Sure, it's possible that the company easily grows into its valuation. But the cyclical nature of semiconductor businesses and the industry's long history of intense competition warrant some caution at the stock's current price.

2024-08-30T04:23:41+00:00,"Intel considers splitting off foundry business, scrapping factory plans- Bloomberg","Investing.com-- Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is considering options to weather a historic slump, which include potentially splitting off its foundry business and scrapping plans for new factories, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.

The chipmaker is in talks with investment bankers over potential options and has met with Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) over a path forward, Bloomberg reported, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

Intel had earlier in August suspended its dividend and slashed about 15% of its workforce, as it struggled to catch up with rivals in the foundry space, chiefly Taiwan's TSMC (NYSE:TSM).

Once the world's leading chipmaker, Intel fell on hard times in the 2000's, amid increased competition from rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), and as it struggled to keep pace with demands from the smartphone and mobile computing industry.

Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) decision to develop its own silicon and stop using Intel chips was also a major blow to the chipmaker.

Intel's challenges came to a head in recent years, with NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominance in artificial intelligence further cutting Intel's sales.

The Bloomberg report showed that Intel was now considering separating its product design and foundry business, while also scrapping plans for expansion as it seeks to streamline its operations.

The company could not be immediately reached for comment.

The AI industry continues to be highly dynamic, with significant growth anticipated across various sectors in 2024. The expansion of generative AI, which saw exponential growth in 2023, is expected to continue this year, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars in value as businesses move from pilot projects to broader implementation. This shift suggests that 2024 will be a pivotal year for AI as companies aim to leverage capabilities more fully to drive efficiency, reduce costs, and innovate across different industries. The market for generative AI is forecasted to grow rapidly, with a compound annual growth rate of close to 60%, reaching a valuation of around $37 billion by 2028. This growth is fueled by the widespread adoption of AI technologies in areas such as healthcare, finance, and customer service.

The AI revolution is already transforming operations across the world by automating tasks, analyzing large datasets, and enhancing predictive capabilities. The healthcare sector, for example, is poised for substantial advancements due to AI, with the market expected to grow to around $188 billion by 2030, driven by innovations in genomics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine. Edge computing is another area likely to see significant development in 2024, as it becomes increasingly critical for enabling AI applications that require real-time data processing. The move towards edge computing, where data is processed closer to the source, is expected to reduce latency and improve the performance of AI systems, particularly in sectors like autonomous vehicles, IoT, and industrial automation.

This trend underscores the growing importance of a robust semiconductor supply chain, especially as global trade tensions and geopolitical events continue to impact the availability of critical components like chips. Experts also emphasize the growing importance of ethical considerations and responsible AI. As AI technologies become more deeply embedded in various aspects of society, concerns around privacy, bias, and security are likely to intensify, prompting calls for clearer regulatory frameworks and guidelines to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly. The rapid growth will also bring challenges related to talent acquisition, supply chain management, and the need for responsible AI practices. As such, the industry is likely to be marked by both tremendous opportunities and complex challenges in the near term.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Top AI Pick for 2025

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The company was recently named the top artificial intelligence stock pick going into 2025 by investment bank Citi. In an investor note, the analysts covering AI at the bank highlighted that early developer feedback on iOS 18, the latest software for iPhones, with beta AI features, had been positive, including the recently launched feature to remove unwanted objects with AI. Per the analysts, this would provide consumers with a compelling reason to upgrade their iPhones. The investor note also eased concerns around the transition to a new CFO and the antitrust case against Google, backing the firm to emerge stronger from the challenges.

Latest reports indicate that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be cutting around 100 jobs in the services department of the firm amid a shift to new AI priorities. The majority of the job cuts are expected in the Apple Books and Apple Bookstore departments. The move is widely seen as a larger plan by the firm to reorganize around artificial intelligence offerings, the most recent of which was the launch of Apple Intelligence earlier this year.

Overall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-08-29T19:36:21+00:00,Nvidia Discusses Joining OpenAI’s Latest Funding Round,"(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. has discussed joining a funding round for OpenAI that would value the artificial intelligence startup at more than $100 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. also have been in talks about participating in the financing, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. The round would be led by Thrive Capital, which is investing about $1 billion, Bloomberg reported earlier this week.

If the discussions move forward, it would mean the three most valuable tech companies are all backing OpenAI, maker of the groundbreaking ChatGPT chatbot. Microsoft was already OpenAI’s biggest funder, having invested roughly $13 billion.

Apple has existing ties with OpenAI as well. The iPhone maker is integrating ChatGPT into its new suite of AI features, called Apple Intelligence. Apple also was slated to take a board observer seat at OpenAI — alongside Microsoft — though those plans were dropped in July.

Nvidia, meanwhile, supplies the critical infrastructure needed to develop and run AI tools like ChatGPT. It’s the biggest maker of so-called AI accelerators, sales of which have soared in the past two years.

Representatives for Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, OpenAI and Thrive all declined to comment.

OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told employees in a memo Wednesday that the company was seeking fresh capital, without giving details, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has been in discussions to raise funding at a valuation at or above $100 billion since at least December, Bloomberg has reported.

The financing would bolster one of the world’s most valuable venture-backed startups. The runaway success of ChatGPT also has kicked off an arms race among tech companies, which are integrating AI technology across their products and funding other promising startups.

In her memo to employees, Friar said that OpenAI would use the financing to acquire more computing power and fund other operating expenses, the people said.

The Wall Street Journal previously reported on the discussions with Apple.

The investment from Apple is part of new OpenAI funding round, led by venture capitalist firm Thrive Capital. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which already holds a 49% a stake in OpenAI, is also set to join the funding round.

Information about how much Apple or Microsoft would invest in OpenAI's funding round round wasn't immediately available, the Journal reported.

Apple's talks to invest in OpenAI comes after the company at its June developers conference unveiled its AI platform ""Apple Intelligence"" that would feature a new version of Siri powered by OpenAI's generative AI model ChatGPT.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was up more than 2% in recent trade.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.

In recent months, the AI industry has been presenting explosive opportunities in the development and deployment of AI infrastructure. Companies that provide AI chips, cloud services, and data storage solutions are poised to benefit from the growing demand for AI capabilities. For example, NVIDIA, a leading provider of AI chips, has seen the shares rally by 160% in 2024, driven by the increasing need for powerful processing capabilities in AI applications. Similarly, cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure are seeing a surge in demand for their AI and machine learning services, making them attractive options for investors.

However, in this buzz around the new tech, investors should also stop and consider some of the risks and challenges associated with AI. Regulatory scrutiny on AI firms is intensifying, particularly around issues of data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the ethical use of AI. Governments worldwide are beginning to implement regulations that could impact how AI technologies are developed and deployed. For instance, the European Union has proposed an AI Act that seeks to create a regulatory framework that addresses the risks associated with AI while promoting innovation. This regulatory environment could lead to increased compliance costs and slower adoption rates in certain sectors, posing a potential risk for investors.

Another critical consideration for investors is the talent shortage in the AI industry. The demand for skilled AI professionals far outstrips supply, leading to fierce competition among companies for top talent. This talent gap could slow down the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in smaller companies that may not have the resources to compete with tech giants like Google and Microsoft for talent. Despite these challenges, the overall outlook for the AI industry remains highly positive. The continuous advancements in AI technologies, coupled with their increasing integration into various sectors, provide a strong foundation for future growth.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The stock has been hit in recent weeks after legendary investor Warren Buffett reduced his holdings in the company significantly during the second quarter of 2024. However, even as some take flight, others have been doubling down on their bets. For example, Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund led by Dan Loeb, recently revealed that it had bought nearly 550,000 shares in the tech giant. Loeb, in a letter to investors, highlighted his bullish views on the company in the field of artificial intelligence. Apple introduced Apple Intelligence earlier this year, a suite of software products designed to make Apple devices like iPhones AI capable.

Loeb underlined that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) would drive meaningful new demand within the installed base with the release of AI features, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. He detailed that iPhone revenue was going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features would not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Furthermore, per Loeb, the App Store was likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer-focused AI apps.

Overall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of trending AI stocks on latest analyst ratings and news. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc.

2024-08-29T15:28:18+00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL): A Beginner Stock You Should Check Out,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Beginner Stocks To Buy Now.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other beginner stocks.

While investing in the stock market carries risk, the US stock market is generally considered a safe place to invest. It has a long history of growth and has consistently recovered from downturns, including major recessions and financial crises.

Over the last four to five years, the market has been hit by several unexpected downturns, due to a global pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other things, that crippled the global economy. However, the US broader market recovered swiftly and has been performing well since 2023. It is nearly 19% up year-to-date, as of August 23.

Nevertheless, it is still a complicated place for beginners and they should consider investing in shares of well-established companies with a history of stable performance and reliability. These stocks typically belong to large, financially sound companies that operate in diverse industries, such as technology, consumer goods, and healthcare.

Additionally, beginners can also look into index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track major market indices like the S&P 500. These options offer diversification, which reduces the risk associated with investing in individual stocks while still providing exposure to the broader market's potential gains. Investing in such well-established and diversified assets can help beginners build confidence and knowledge in the stock market. For such ETFs, you can check out our article on the best large-cap growth ETFs.

Opportunities and Caution for New Investors Due to Consumer Behaviour

On August 16, Melissa Minkow, director of retail strategy at CI&T, discussed the latest trends in U.S. consumer spending in a CNBC interview. Despite concerns about a potential recession, Minkow believes we might have avoided one. She pointed out that although consumers may feel like they are in a recession, their spending habits show otherwise. They continue to spend, especially when presented with discounts. Retailers have adapted by offering more targeted promotions this year, which has helped maintain consumer spending despite previous challenges like the pandemic and supply chain issues.

Minkow also noted that the effectiveness of promotions can vary across sectors. For example, quick-service restaurants like McDonald's and Starbucks haven’t seen the same benefits from discounts as other retailers, partly because consumers may opt for more cost-effective alternatives like home-cooked meals. Additionally, brands that are already positioned as discount options might not see as much impact from promotions. However, retailers who offer significant discounts on desirable items can attract cost-conscious shoppers and increase sales volume, potentially offsetting the impact on profit margins.

Story continues

For beginner investors in the stock market, the current retail sector dynamics offer both opportunities and challenges. The resilience of consumer spending, even in the face of economic uncertainty, suggests that certain sectors and companies could continue to perform well, especially those that effectively use promotions to drive sales. Retailers offering targeted discounts on popular items may attract more customers, boosting their sales volumes, which could lead to positive stock performance.

However, beginner investors should also be cautious. Not all companies benefit equally from promotions, as seen with the restaurant and food segment, where discounts haven’t significantly improved earnings. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific business models and market positioning of companies before investing.

The Market is Healthy but Caution is Advised

The U.S. stocks have seen a significant surge over the last few quarters, which are mainly driven by strong economic data and optimism about a potential soft landing for the U.S. economy. However, experts remain cautious as we discussed in our best defensive stocks article.

In the article, we discussed the J.P. Morgan report that noted the market's heavy reliance on large, high-quality tech and AI companies, and it warned that maintaining this momentum could be challenging due to high valuations and potential market volatility. Here is an excerpt from the article:

“According to a July report by J.P Morgan, recent market trends have benefited large, high-quality companies, especially in tech and AI, which have resulted in high market concentration. However, maintaining this momentum in the second half of 2024 could be difficult due to high valuations and investor positioning. The report says that while U.S. market volatility is currently low, it could rise if conditions change.

According to Bruce Kasman, global growth is steady at 2.4%, with improved recoveries in Western Europe and emerging markets, along with a rebound in the manufacturing sector. Despite this, core global inflation is projected to remain around 3% in 2024, which could limit the potential for policy easing. Kasman warned that achieving inflation control and rate normalization might weaken demand and could interact with political factors to cause further inflation and central bank tightening.”

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184

10-year Revenue CAGR: 8.03%

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a prominent American multinational technology company and is known for its groundbreaking consumer electronics, software, and services. The company first gained recognition with the launch of its Apple I personal computer.

Over the years, the company has transformed into one of the world’s most valuable brands, renowned for its flagship products such as the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. In addition to its hardware, it offers a range of digital services, including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Pay, and AppleCare. It is fourth on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy now.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has long been a significant player in the technology sector, and it is set to build on its position with an ambitious push into generative AI. While AI has been part of the company's ecosystem for years, through the Siri virtual assistant, it is ready to better its AI capabilities with the upcoming launch of Apple Intelligence.

The new suite of features, expected within the year, will introduce a refreshed Siri interface and offer functionalities such as email summarization, content rewriting in various tones, and phone call transcriptions. Future updates will include integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, which further expands its AI capabilities.

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been integrating AI accelerators into its M-series processors from the start, which positions the company uniquely in the tech landscape. By making Apple Intelligence compatible with all Apple Silicon Macs, iPads with M-series processors, Vision Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and future iPhones, the company will likely possess the largest base of AI-capable devices. Its devices, powered by the M-series and A17 Pro processors, will possibly be able to handle complex AI tasks directly on the device rather than relying on cloud computing.

In addition to these advancements, the company remains a high-margin leader in the tech industry. In the third quarter, it saw a 5% increase in net sales, reaching $85.8 billion. This growth was fueled by a 14% rise in services revenue and substantial iPhone sales, which totaled $39.3 billion.

With its continued innovation in AI and robust financial performance, the company is well-positioned for sustained growth and market leadership. The expansion of AI functionalities across its product lineup and impressive sales figures highlight the company's ongoing potential and strategic direction.

In the second quarter, 184 hedge funds had stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), with total positions worth $124.175 billion. With 400 million shares worth $84.248 billion, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the most prominent shareholder in the company, as of June 30.

Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

Overall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best beginner stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

2024-08-29T09:22:08+00:00,"Jim Cramer on Apple Inc. (AAPL): ‘Own It, Don’t Trade It’","We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Jim Cramer Believes Will Soar.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer believes will soar.

On a recent episode of Mad Money, Jim Cramer reflects on Wall Street's favorite GPU maker's remarkable journey and current status in the stock market. After the sharp decline three weeks ago, caused by the sudden sell-off linked to the yen carry trade, the market is rebounding.

""We’ve had a remarkable run from the lows three weeks ago as we realized that the forced selling caused by the implosion of the yen carry trade is merely temporary.""

Cramer notes that the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate cuts should support this recovery. However, Wall Street has become more selective, and investors are less forgiving of mediocre results now that the market has rallied significantly.

""Now the Fed is our friend again with rate cuts on the way, starting at next month’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. At the same time, though, after such a spectacular rally, Wall Street’s gotten a little more discerning. Investors are no longer willing to give companies a pass for less-than-stellar results once we reach more elevated levels. That’s what happens—the exuberance goes away. Now we’re in a tricky moment that feels like a race against time.""

Cramer emphasizes that the current economic climate is uncertain. The economy is slowing, and while the Fed's rate cuts are expected to help, their impact is unpredictable. The effectiveness of these measures and the extent of the economic downturn remain unclear.

""While the economy is slowing and we know the Fed rate-cut cavalry is riding to the rescue, we just don’t know how effective it will be and how bad things will get before Fed Chief Powell manages to turn the tide—and he will. We need to figure out how quickly the economy will deteriorate and how quickly the rate cuts will work their magic. Both of these are judgment calls, and we don’t necessarily have enough data to decide either way. We never do at this point in what we call the economic cycle.""

Jim Cramer: In my 43 Years on Wall Street, I’ve Never Seen Anything Like This

According to Cramer, Nvidia has captured extraordinary attention from investors. He describes it as a groundbreaking company, now valued at $3.2 trillion, a dramatic increase from $580 billion just 18 months ago. Cramer highlights its dominance in the semiconductor industry and its influence on technology, particularly in artificial intelligence.

""I searched for comparisons and came up grasping at something ethereal to describe this incredible $3.2 trillion company, which was worth just $580 billion 18 months ago. It has captivated not just investors but people far removed from the stock market. It’s almost miraculous how many have had life-changing experiences because of this single stock.""

Despite its impressive achievements, Cramer notes that the stock's performance will be scrutinized closely. He points out that the company's quarterly results need to surpass high expectations, including significant revenue beats and strong future guidance.

""But tomorrow, the stock will descend into mere mortality, and I feel compelled to explain why. Why does it hold such a high status, and why can it never fully live up to the hype of its $3.2 trillion market cap based solely on one quarterly report? The quarter is about it beating earnings estimates, topping revenue numbers, and crushing forecasts. The stock has run so high that it needs a $2 billion revenue beat and guidance that’s $2 billion higher than expected, along with a bullish conference call discussing a strong roadmap. And let’s not forget a gigantic buyback because the company has too much cash sitting idle.""

Cramer concludes that the company's technology is so advanced that it’s difficult to fully grasp its future potential. Despite this, he believes the company's achievements should be celebrated, and the stock might still hold significant upside surprises.

""The bottom line: I don’t want to be poetic, but it excels in ways that are unmatched. We should celebrate its achievements and bring on those upside surprises.""

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 184

Jim Cramer addresses recent changes in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s leadership, specifically the retirement of CFO Luca Maestri, a highly regarded executive known for his exceptional financial stewardship. Despite initial market reactions that saw Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s stock dip slightly and prompted some to view the change with concern, Cramer remains confident in the company's future. Maestri’s tenure saw Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s revenue and earnings grow significantly, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s market cap soaring from $547 billion to nearly $3.5 trillion.

""Apple's C-suite is being shaken up, but I'll tell you why it's not shaking my confidence in the company going forward. Own it, don't trade it. Apple's stock briefly got rocked this morning after we learned that CFO Luca Maestri, one of the best in the business, is retiring. Luca is a hero. He's been the steward of Apple's cash and has done his best to add value for all shareholders, much better than almost every other CFO out there. So what happens to the stock upon the news of his retirement? It goes down a buck and a half in pre-market trading, and we get a host of notes saying that Luca's decision is either a mild negative for the stock or a real negative—a reason to be worried and a cause of disappointment and concern.

It's been 10 years for Luca, a little longer than the average CFO term, during which Apple's revenues have compounded at an 8% annual clip, while its earnings compounded at a 15% clip. Apple's market capitalization expanded more than six times, from $547 billion to nearly $3.5 trillion today. Luca has been incredible at planning the success of the service revenue stream, which is now close to $100 billion. He's helped grow the company in key emerging markets like India, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia, Brazil, and the UAE, which together are becoming a real force. I'd argue he's been a genius when it comes to buying back stock, always purchasing it when it's right, not just repurchasing shares by rote, as most CFOs do...

In the midst of an endless parade of commentators who want you to trade, many of whom make money if you trade, there is Apple—the one and only stock that's run the way you want a company to run, which is why I always say own it, don't trade it. I can't think of a thing Apple does wrong when it comes to running the business day-to-day, and I know that Luca played a big role in that. The highest compliment I can pay is that I bet Kevin Park will do exactly the same.""

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) offers a strong investment opportunity due to its leadership in technology innovation, growing ecosystem, and solid financial health. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s recent product launches, including the iPhone 15 series, iPad Pro, and new MacBook models, showcase its commitment to cutting-edge technology and have been positively received by consumers, strengthening its market position. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s ecosystem, which integrates its hardware, software, and services, is expanding rapidly. Investments in its Services segment—such as Apple Music, iCloud, and Apple TV+—along with recent advancements in AI, are boosting recurring revenue and improving customer engagement.

Additionally, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s strategic investments in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and health technology, including the new Apple Watch Series 9, position it well for future growth and continued market leadership. Overall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s innovation, expanding ecosystem, strong financial standing, and forward-looking investments make it an appealing investment choice.

Overall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer believes will soar.

Shares in chip company Nvidia fell in after-hours trading, following second quarter earnings which showed the smallest revenue beat in six quarters.

Nvidia was down nearly 7% in pre-market trading, despite the chipmaker reporting second quarter figures that beat expectations on the top and bottom line after the US bell on Wednesday.

The company, a world leader in chip design and software, reported revenues of $30bn (£22.7bn) in its fiscal second quarter, compared to analysts' forecasts of $28.8bn.

Ben Barringer, technology and media analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: “Nvidia has grown to a point where there is little room for error and any sign of slowing or normalisation of growth will have an outsized effect on the share price.”

“This being the smallest beat in six quarters, and the fact guidance for gross margins and costs are weaker was enough to get people to hit the sell button in after hours trading.”

Tech stocks led US markets lower on Wednesday as investors awaited the highly-anticipated results, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) closing 1.1% down.

Salesforce (CRM)

Software company Salesforce posted second quarter results after the US market close on Wednesday that beat Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins and earnings.

Salesforce posted net sales of $9.33bn for the second quarter, above an estimate of $9.23bn.

Shares popped in after-hours trading, up 5%.

Sales increased 11% in Europe, 16% in Asia-Pacific, and 8% in its Americas segment in the second quarter. This marked a turnaround from the previous quarter when the company posted its first sales estimate miss since 2006.

""What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin,” Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance.

The company also reported an adjusted operating margin of 33.7%, coming in above estimates of 31.94%.

“Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history,"" Miner said.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B)

Shares in Warren Buffet’s company were trending in pre-market trading as it hit $1tn (£756bn) in market value — the first US company outside of the tech sector to reach the milestone.

The $1tn threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” Buffet turns 94 years old.

Berkshire Hathaway comprises a $285bn stock portfolio that Buffett has built up over six decades, making him one of the richest people in the world.

In recent months, Berkshire Hathaway has been in selling mode. It cut its stake in Apple (AAPL) by 50% last quarter. On Tuesday, the company disclosed it had sold nearly 25 million Bank of America (BAC) shares worth close to $1bn.

Berkshire’s insurance, energy, manufacturing, retail and service businesses generated $22.8bn of profit in the first half of the year, up 26% from a year earlier.

Topping the list of the most valuable companies are Apple, Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), which all are worth more than $3tn. Other companies trading above $1tn include Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META).

Super Micro Computer (SMCI)

Shares in the AI server maker were almost 7% lower in pre-market trading after plunging over 19% during Wednesday’s session after it said it would delay the filing of its annual report.

″SMCI is unable to file its annual report within the prescribed time period without unreasonable effort or expense,” the company said. “Additional time is needed for SMCI’s management to complete its assessment of the design and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of 30 June 2024.”

That announcement came a day after short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report that alleged it found “glaring accounting red flags” and other issues at the company.

Analysts at JPMorgan said some of Hindenburg’s claims are “tough to verify” and that the report is “largely void of details around alleged wrong doings from the company”.

Hindenburg Research said its three-month investigation found ""evidence of undisclosed related party transactions, sanctions and export control failures, and customer issues"". The firm disclosed on Tuesday that it had taken a short position in Super Micro.

The Chinese networking and electronics leader posted a revenue of 239 billion yuan ($33.6 billion) in the June quarter, up 33.7% from a year earlier, according to calculations based on company’s six-month financial figures.

Implied net profit was 35.5 billion yuan, a drop of 18.6% from a year ago when Huawei recorded one-time gains from divestments. The company sold mobile maker Honor Device Co. to a consortium in 2020 and parts of its server business in 2021, with proceeds from both paid out in installments.

The Shenzhen-based company’s smartphone shipments rose by 50% last quarter as it and other local players like Vivo and Xiaomi Corp. beat out Apple, which dropped to sixth place among handset makers in China, according to market tracker IDC. Apple’s sales in China fell 6.5% in the June quarter, missing Wall Street projections, even as overall shipments in China grew.

Huawei’s next flagship Mate 70 will be closed watched for any processor upgrades when the device is introduced later this year. The Mate 60 roiled US policymakers when it debuted a China-made 7-nanometer chip a year ago, despite US-imposed sanctions and export controls geared to stem advances in China’s chip technologies.

The company’s automotive unit, which offers self-driving technology to electric vehicle makers, earned a revenue of 10 billion yuan as of early July, according to a report by Chinese media outlet, more than the combined revenue in the previous two years. Huawei didn’t provide a breakdown of its sales.

Shares of the SaaS company popped 4% in after-hours trading on Wednesday as it bested Wall Street estimates on sales, operating margins, and earnings.

The reaction — and tone around the quarter's performance — is in stark contrast to just three months ago, when the company shockingly missed sales estimates for the first time since 2006.

Demand remains strong, and there are ""big goals"" for operating margins and cash flow, Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told me on Yahoo Finance.

Sales increased 11% in Europe and 16% in Asia-Pacific on a constant currency basis. The company's Americas segment notched 8% sales growth.

""I don't think anyone expected a repeat performance of that [last quarter],"" Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner said on Yahoo Finance.

Added Miner, ""What I think a lot of people are excited about right now is the beat on adjusted operating margin. Profitability has become fully the focus for Salesforce over the last six quarters, you can't miss there right now, especially when [sales] growth is decelerating into the single digits as it is only the second time in their company history.""

The company maintained its full year sales outlook, but lifted its expectations for operating margins. That may spur enthusiasm that Salesforce's various AI initiatives will boost profits.

To that end, Benioff teased the coming launch of AgentForce, which features AI sales agents that go beyond chatbots and can resolve customer inquiries. Benioff says more details will be shared in September at the company's closely watched Dreamforce conference.

But he tells me the service is a higher margin opportunity and will be priced by conversation. Benioff envisions one billion agents in service by the end of fiscal year 2026.

He also says Microsoft has ""misled"" customers ""that they have to do so much heavy lifting on the technology side."" Salesforce aims to enable customers to train their models within its platform.

""They get real value from AI now,"" he says of Salesforce's offerings.

""One of the biggest initiatives in the field is around monetizing the AI theme within the Salesforce massive installed base. We believe this is a major land grab opportunity that could significantly benefit Salesforce over the coming years and could increase overall revenue by $4 billion+ annually based on our estimates and field work by 2025,"" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a client note.

The earnings rundown

Net Sales: $9.33 billion (+8% year over year) vs. $9.23 billion estimate (guidance: $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion Current Remaining Performance Obligations: $26.5 billion vs. $26.31 billion Adjusted Operating Margin: 33.7% vs. 31.94% estimate Diluted EPS: $2.56 (+21% year over year) vs. $2.35 estimate

2024-08-28T22:45:23+00:00,One Tech Tip: How to get the most life out of your device,"LONDON (AP) — If you want to use your shiny new iPhone for as long as possible, you better take good care of it.

Most people are now holding on to smartphones longer instead of regularly upgrading them, and there are many reasons why.

At the dawn of the smartphone age, you might have upgraded to a new device every few years to make sure you had the latest must-have features or because your carrier's contract subsidized the purchase of the newest model. But that's no longer the case as smartphone technology has matured and innovations have become more incremental, and carrier pricing models have changed.

There's also an environmental push to keep old phones out of landfills as electronic waste becomes a larger sustainability issue. Smartphones these days are also just sturdier and better able to survive dunks and shocks.

“As long as you take care of your phone and keep it updated, you’re going to get at least four or five good years of use out of it,"" said Chris Hauk, of Pixel Privacy, a tech website. Some device owners boast in online forums that they've had phones last more than seven years.

And if you're paying over $1,000 for your smartphone, you'll probably want to it to last as long as it can. Here are some tips to extend the lifespan of your Apple or Android mobile device:

Battery care

One of the biggest factor in your phone's lifespan is the battery. A rechargeable battery's chemical age isn't related to when it was manufactured. Instead, it's based on a complex mix of factors including “temperature history and charging pattern,” according to Apple.

“As lithium-ion batteries chemically age, the amount of charge they can hold diminishes, resulting in reduced battery life and reduced peak performance,” the iPhone maker says.

The company says its charging optimization technology is designed to improve battery life, and it’s safe for iPhone users to charge their phones overnight.

Samsung, meanwhile, says its lithium ion batteries do best when kept above 50% charge. It advises against running the battery down.

“Repeatedly allowing the battery to drain fully may shorten its life and decrease its overall capacity,” the company says in an online guide. “If this happens, you’ll need to charge the battery more frequently and it may last only a few hours before needing a charge, for example.”

Avoid extreme temperatures

Apple says says that batteries warm up as they charge, which can shorten their lifespan. It warns against using your phone or charging it in very hot temperatures, above 95 degrees (35 Celsius), “which can permanently reduce battery lifespan.”

Story continues

Samsung also says extreme heat or cold can damage batteries and warns people not to, for example, leave their phones in a car's glove box when it's very hot or cold. And don't put your phone in a freezer either, it's a myth that it can prolong battery life. “This is not correct and can damage your battery,” Samsung says.

Google, which makes the Android operating system and Pixel phones, says hot batteries drain faster, even when they're not in use, and that can damage the battery.

Adjust your power options

Tweak your device settings so apps or features use less power, which extends your battery's daily life and the time between charging cycles.

You can turn down your phone's screen brightness, turn on the dark theme and reduce the time for the screen to power off. Enable the auto-brightness feature, which adjusts screen brightness according to the level of ambient light. Also check battery usage in your settings to see if there are any power-hungry apps you can switch off or uninstall.

If the power level dips below 10%, iPhone users can turn on low power mode to stretch their battery's life before it need recharging. Samsung's Android phones have a similar “power saving mode.” You can also leave it on all the time, but it might affect your phone's performance.

Samsung says users can switch off Bluetooth or Wi-Fi if they’re not being used, although Apple advises leaving them on because they draw minimal power when not connected.

Use protection

Phones are sleek capsules but the glossy surface means they can slip easily out of your hand. So it goes without saying that you should get a sturdy protective case to help cushion the blow when you accidentally drop it.

Don't forget a screen protector. Plastic versions are the cheapest option but can scuff easily, according to device repair website iFixit, which recommends ones made with TPU film or tempered glass, which offer better protection against scratches and drops.

Keep your device clean

Keeping your phone in your pocket or purse means its ports and sockets can collect lint and other debris that you'll need to clean out.

“Take a little toothpick and just kind of get in and get rid of any debris,” said Hauk. ""Also the speaker and the microphone grills on phones, they do get dirty,” so use a toothbrush to clean them, he said. Just make sure you're flicking the debris away from the phone instead of pushing it deeper inside the tiny holes.

Update your device

Software is another important factor in a phone's lifespan. Experts advise keeping your operating system and apps up to date so they have the latest privacy, security and battery management features.

That will be easier to do as your phone ages because some device makers have been extending the time limit for providing updates.

Google has pledged to provide Pixel 8 and newer phones with seven years of Android and security updates, compared with four to five years for older models. Samsung has also extended its operating system updates to seven years starting with its flagship S24 device launched earlier this year.

Apple doesn't spell out how long it will support iOS updates for devices, although older devices like the iPhone 6s released in 2014 and the iPhone 8 were still getting security updates this year.

2024-08-28T22:37:00+00:00,Prediction: This Under-the-Radar Tech Stock Will Outperform Nvidia and Apple by 2030,"Tech giants Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are on top of the world nowadays. They are the two most valuable stocks on the market, looking back at market-beating returns in the past five years. Apple's total returns delivered a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 36% in that period. Nvidia soared even higher with a 100% five-year CAGR. The artificial intelligence (AI) boom has been mighty kind to Nvidia's investors.

They achieved these massive gains in a strong era for the general market, but the S&P 500 index looks downright sleepy by comparison: AAPL Total Return Level Chart

It would be cool if Nvidia and Apple were poised to continue their market-beating ways from here. Invest in the biggest, baddest names on the market, sit back and relax, and let them deliver more of the same good stuff for years to come. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that both stocks are a bit overvalued at today's massive market caps -- $3.1 trillion for Nvidia and $3.4 trillion for Apple. I know it's like comparing mountains of cash to rivers of revenues, but these two market caps add up to about 23% of America's gross domestic product.

I think that's too much. Apple and Nvidia may be overdue for a painful correction. At best, I don't expect them to rise much higher in the foreseeable future.

At the same time, good old International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) is gaining ground in the AI space, and its stock is undervalued today. I don't expect IBM's stock to pass the trillion-dollar mark in the next five years, but it should most certainly rise as Big Blue's enterprise-class AI tools add value to the stock. Most investors don't see this traditional computing giant as a promising AI investment yet. That's a big mistake.

Don't forget IBM's cash-profit chops

IBM's valuation ratios don't look terribly exciting at first glance. The stock is changing hands at 22 times trailing earnings and 2.9 times sales. Those are perfectly acceptable middle-of-the-road values for mature companies, just below the averages seen in the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average market indices.

Then your eye slides over to IBM's price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio, and the stock suddenly looks different. When you calculate IBM's values based on its massive cash profit, the stock seems to belong in Wall Street's bargain bin instead. This ratio stops at 14 times free cash flows, just over half of the S&P 500's or Dow Jones' readings.

Cash is king, and IBM has plenty of it. The company's rich cash profits and relatively modest bottom-line earnings show that Big Blue's accountants are very good at lowering taxable profits while putting lots of real greenbacks in the bank. I see cash flow as a higher-quality measure of profitability, so it's easy to look away from IBM's moderate price-to-earnings ratio.

Story continues

IBM's place in the AI boom

Remember the five-year chart I showed you? IBM's chart for the same period is a different animal: IBM Total Return Level Chart

The stock has underperformed broad market indices for many years as it transformed a hardware-heavy business model into a more profitable software and services plan. In particular, you should know that the revamped Big Blue comes with a heavy focus on cloud computing, data security, and AI tools.

Yes, this company was a leading AI researcher long before ChatGPT's release opened the floodgates for AI investments. Many investors seem to have missed that connection since IBM's business results didn't immediately skyrocket in this soaring AI era. The big AI contracts are coming, just a bit late.

You see, IBM is happy to leave consumer-friendly ideas such as ChatGPT-style chatbots to other tech providers. This company will always go after large corporate contracts instead, adding extra layers of security, business-friendly data analytics, and lawsuit-repellant data tracking to the mix. Potential clients may take several quarters to test and approve the resulting AI recipe, but the end result is a lucrative long-term deal that won't be easy to replace.

The approvals are rolling in now, building a robust revenue stream for the long run. Market makers are still not paying attention, so IBM's stock keeps trading at incredibly low cash flow ratios. I can't wait to see what happens in a couple of years, when the AI contracts have become generous and highly profitable revenue streams.

One more thing...

I'll admit that Nvidia and Apple are making solid cash profits, too. However, their sky-high stock prices already account for these high-quality profits. Apple's P/FCF ratio stands at 33 today, and Nvidia's is soaring at 79 times free cash flows.

Thanks, but no thanks. I'd much rather buy IBM's undervalued stock instead.

2024-08-28T20:33:27+00:00,Is Apple Siri the Best AI Assistant in 2024?,"We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Siri stands against the other AI assistants.

As we have mentioned in our article, “10 Most Popular AI Penny Stocks Under $1,"" the estimated value of the global artificial intelligence market in 2023 was $196.63 billion, and between 2024 and 2030, it is expected to increase at a CAGR of 36.6%.

Regionally, in terms of revenue, the North American AI market held a 30.9% share in 2023, while from 2024 to 2030, the artificial intelligence industry in Europe is expected to grow at a significant CAGR of 33.2%, per Grand View Research. Moreover, the artificial intelligence and robotics markets in the United States have advanced significantly, with an estimated valuation of $42.00 billion in 2023.

The U.S. Census Bureau survey indicates that industry-specific AI adoption rates differ. The information and professional, scientific, and technical services sectors dominate in this regard, with 18% and 12% of businesses reporting present use of AI, respectively, while agriculture and construction have low AI adoption rates of 1% each.

With the launch of ChatGPT, AI technologies are still at the forefront of AI market trends. After launching in November 2022, OpenAI claims that ChatGPT, its AI tool, attracted over a million users in just five days. The Head of AI & Data at Deloitte Switzerland, Marc Beierschoder, is unequivocal on the significance of AI in day-to-day business, stating that ""AI is not a passing fad."" In the distant past, a dazzling toy that would momentarily enhance a company's reputation for innovation has evolved into a vital instrument for smooth corporate operations. Particularly, employees are already accustomed to using generative AI technologies like ChatGPT and DALL-E, which generate fresh content in the form of text, photos, audio files, or videos.

If 2023 was the year that generative AI (Gen AI) was first introduced to the world, then 2024 is the year that businesses really started utilizing this new technology and reaping its benefits. According to the McKinsey Global AI May 30, 2024 Survey, 65% of participants claimed their companies use generative artificial intelligence on a regular basis. This is almost twice as many as the survey's results from just 10 months ago. Respondents' expectations for Gen AI's impact are as high as they were last year, with three-quarters forecasting major or disruptive change in their industry in the next years.

Another study by PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence, ""Sizing the Prize: Exploiting the AI Revolution,"" examines the enormous potential that artificial intelligence holds for economies and businesses. According to the study, artificial intelligence could boost GDP in local economies by up to 26% and add an incredible $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. As businesses look to ""augment"" the productivity of their labor force using AI technology and automate some jobs and roles, advances in labor productivity will fuel initial GDP growth. Additionally, the analysis indicates that by 2030, improvements to products will drive up consumer demand and account for 45% of all economic gains. This is due to the fact that AI will eventually lead to a wider range of products that are more affordable, individualized, and attractive. China and North America stand to gain the most from AI, with China's GDP expected to rise by 26% and 14.5%, respectively, to reach a total of $10.7 trillion, which represents over 70% of the global economic impact.

Methodology:

To pick out the 11 Best AI Assistants in 2024, we searched the internet for the best AI assistants in 2024 and ranked them based on their number of appearances in our sources, so each appearance got one Insider Monkey score. Then we ranked the list based on the aggregated scores.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Apple Siri

Insider Monkey Score: 11

AI-powered Siri is a virtual assistant included in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s watchOS, tvOS, and iOS operating systems. It makes recommendations, executes commands, and responds to questions by using voice recognition to assign requests to online services. Siri is well known for its strong safety and easy-to-use interface.

Apple is planning to replace Siri with AI to manage different application features. The concept is to use voice to control functionality within specific apps.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were NVIDIA, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Salesforce. In a reversal from some of the concerns driving the stock down in the first quarter, Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.”

Overall AAPL ranks 4th on our list of the best AI assistants in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about cheapest AI stock.

2024-08-28T19:42:38+00:00,Google revamps controversial AI image generation tool after backlash,"After Google pulled the ability for its AI chatbot to generate images of people, the search giant is reintroducing the feature following a high profile backlash.

Google on Wednesday said that it will start to roll out an updated image generation tool for users of the English-language version its AI chatbot, Gemini Advanced. The service will also feature Google's latest image generation model, Imagen 3.

In February, Google disabled the ability of users to generate images of humans after the company acknowledged that its tool would ""overcompensate"" in seeking to depict diverse ranges of people, even in unrealistic or absurd scenarios. The episode highlighted the company's scramble to get it on the AI frenzy, and the risks of releasing new technology without rigorous vetting.

A social media firestorm drew attention to images that, for example, depicted a Black woman as a US founding father and showed Black and Asian people as Nazi-era German soldiers.

Some users wielded the results as evidence of an anti-white bias in what the tool generated.

The viral images sparked criticism from prominent figures, including X owner Elon Musk, who has previously criticized the perceived liberal bias of AI tools. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told staff at the time that some of the faulty responses were unacceptable, and that ""we got it wrong.""

""With Imagen 3, we’ve made significant progress in providing a better user experience when generating images of people,"" said Dave Citron, a senior director at Google, in a blog post on Wednesday.

The reintroduction is the latest development in Google's AI rollouts, which have been uneven at times.

Last year, Google fumbled the release of its initial AI chatbot Bard, when it spit out inaccurate responses during a promotional video.

Taken together, the episodes underscored the perceived sloppiness of the launches and undermined Google's credibility, just as tech giants were jostling for position amid the AI hype. Google said it has upgraded its creative image generation capabilities and will bring its latest image generation model, Imagen 3 to Gemini Apps (AP Photo/Juliana Yamada) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)

In an effort to prevent abuse, the tool won't support the generation of photorealistic scenes of identifiable individuals, minors or excessive violence, Citron said.

""Of course, as with any generative AI tool, not every image Gemini creates will be perfect, but we’ll continue to listen to feedback from early users as we keep improving. We'll gradually roll this out, aiming to bring it to more users and languages soon.""

Google's re-release comes at a fraught moment in the AI world.

In the months since the search giant originally released and pulled the tool, investors have wavered in their support of AI investments. Recent market volatility has resurfaced questions about the valuations of tech companies which have thrown enormous resources behind ambitious AI buildouts.

Story continues

The competitive landscape has also changed.

While Google was previously seen as playing catchup to Microsoft (MSFT), Apple has since joined the Big Tech AI party. And while the iPhone maker's rivals were dealing with boardroom drama and public backlash over AI developments, Wall Street has applauded Apple's efforts, highlighting the company's success at marketing AI tools in ways that other tech giants have struggled through.

Google's reintroduction of the image generation feature also came just ahead of a pivotal earnings release from Nvidia (NVDA). Shares of the AI chip designer are up about 160% so far this year. And AI bulls view a potential blowout report as the next catalyst in what has been a challenging market for chips and AI companies.

Daniel Loeb-backed Third Point hedge fund bet big on the stock, according to Street.com, on its latest AI initiative. Third Point started to buy Apple shares in April, and the stock was one of its portfolio's top five winners for the second quarter.

Loeb also said that Apple’s stock had become increasingly 'under-owned' by institutional investors, and its relative multiple had squeezed toward a multi-year low, despite Apple stock’s recent run.  In its second-quarter earnings report, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a huge reduction in its stake in Apple, citing high valuations, as quoted on Economic Times.

Should You Play Apple Stock With ETFs?

Since there still are uncertainties related to the success of Apple’s upcoming AI rollout, it is better to track the company with the exchange-traded-fund (ETF) approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks. Apple-heavy ETFs include the likes of Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW. Let’s delve a little deeper into the stock’s potential.

Apple's AI Initiative

Loeb has previewed Apple’s new artificial intelligence feature, ""Apple Intelligence,"" as a gamechanger. The AI feature is set to launch in October with iOS 18. This feature looks to enhance Siri (Apple’s original smartphone voice assistant), automate tasks like email generation and image sorting, and integrate advanced functions such as automated photo cleanup and ChatGPT. Loeb expects AI-driven growth to bolster revenues and earnings of Apple.

Apple’s Privacy-Focused Cloud Services

Apple has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute to ensure user privacy. This service uses Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities that determine whether a request can be processed on device or needs cloud access. Apple has assured that no user information will be stored in the cloud.

Recent Financial Performance of Apple

Apple reported robust third-quarter earnings, surpassing earnings per share and revenue estimates. While iPhone sales remain important, the iPad segment saw strong growth, indicating market expansion opportunities. However, challenges in Greater China impacted regional sales.

Broker Rating for AAPL Stock

Story continues

Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.73 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated on the basis of actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 31 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.62 a month ago based on 30 recommendations.

Of the 31 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 19 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 61.29% and 9.68% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 66.67%, while Buy represented 10%.

Price Target for AAPL Shares

Based on short-term price targets offered by 31 analysts, the average price target for Apple stock comes to $241.68. The forecasts range from a low of $184.00 to a high of $300.00. The average price target represents an increase of 6.38% from the closing price of $227.18 recorded on Monday.

Any Wall of Worry for Apple?

Apple’s competitors have faced several AI hiccups before. Google’s Bard provided incorrect answers, and its Gemini image generator displayed inaccurate images. Microsoft’s Copilot+PC standard raised security concerns, while Meta faced criticism for not allowing users to disable its AI chatbot. Apple has always thrived on its reputation for security. Hence, any flaws in its generative AI efforts could harm its brand.

2024-08-28T15:40:59+00:00,Warren Buffett's Berkshire joins the $1 trillion club,"Investing.com -- Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) reached a historic milestone on Wednesday, becoming the first non-technology company in the U.S. to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization.

The Omaha-based conglomerate's stock has surged over 30% in 2024, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. This impressive feat comes just days before Buffett, often referred to as the 'Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of Omaha,' celebrates his 94th birthday.

On Wednesday, Berkshire's shares climbed to an all-time high, pushing the company's market value past the $1 trillion mark.

Unlike the other members of the trillion-dollar club—Apple, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta—Berkshire Hathaway is distinguished by its focus on traditional industries.

The company owns a diverse array of businesses. However, Berkshire's significant investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also been a significant contributor to its recent growth.

Buffett took control of Berkshire in the 1960s and has since transformed it into a vast empire with interests in insurance, railroads, retail, and energy. The company is renowned for its strong balance sheet and substantial cash reserves.

Recently, Buffett has adopted a more cautious approach, selling off a large amount of stock—including half of Berkshire's Apple holdings—and amassing a record $277 billion in cash by the end of June.

On Wednesday, it was revealed that over the past few days, Berkshire has sold more shares of Bank of America as the company continues to trim its stake in the U.S. lender.

According to regulatory filings, Berkshire has sold around $5.4 billion worth of Bank of America shares sales since mid-July. According to a regulatory filing on Tuesday, between August 23 and 27, the company is said to have sold roughly 24.7 million shares of the lender.

The AI-led rally in the stock market is expected to ripple through other sectors and smaller tech companies, but analysts believe for now large-cap companies are still the key focus of money managers. Morgan Stanley in its August key themes report said that while small-cap stocks rebounded on rate-cut hopes, the window for their outperformance is “too narrow.”

“Historically small cap outperformance depended primarily on economic growth acceleration. Greater risk exposure to a “higher-for-longer” rate environment has added inverse rate correlation to the mix. While periods of growth acceleration with lower rates are plausible (e.g. end-2023), we see this combination as relatively unlikely in the current inflation environment. The recent decline in interest rates was a tailwind to small cap stocks, but softer economic data likely limits the durability of this trade,” the firm said.

The latest earnings season showed that ROI on the huge AI spending by major companies is small in the short term, but long-term gains seem promising. Many companies have already started seeing monetization on their AI investments.  Goldman Sachs analysts Joseph Briggs, Kash Rangan, and Eric Sheridan said in a June report titled GEN AI: TOO MUCH SPEND, TOO LITTLE BENEFIT? that they remain more optimistic about AI’s economic potential even if we don’t see immediate benefits for now.

Hedge funds are one step ahead of average individual investors due to the sheer scale of resources and capital they have. That’s why it’s always interesting to see which stocks they are buying and selling. In this article we take a look at the 10 most important AI stocks which were on the radar of elite money managers based on their second-quarter filings.

Perhaps the biggest news around Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) related to the latest 13F filings from hedge funds was Warren Buffett’s Berkshire cutting its stake in the company by 50%. Who else is jumping the Apple ship? Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller’s Duquesne Family Office cut its stakes in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to 24,000 shares during Q2 from about 115,000 shares. Billionaire Ray Dalio’s fund reduced its position in the company to 469K shares from 1.84 million shares. Billionaire DE Shaw’s fund cut its Apple stake by 33%. Billionaire Israel Englander, on the other hand, increased his stake in the company by 68% via Millennium Management.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.

“We believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced ‘Apple Intelligence’ suite of AI-enabled smartphone features – the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant – will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple’s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,  iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple’s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple’s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.”

Loeb reiterated the bull case that many other Wall Street analysts have made. This case assumes that millions of people will upgrade their iPhones because they’d want to use AI-powered new models of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) flagship device.

However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.

Third Point Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

In April, we took a position in Apple, the world’s leading consumer technology franchise, with an ecosystem of 2.2 billion devices spanning a broad array of form factors including smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, earphones, and smart home devices. Apple excels in most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets.

Despite Apple’s dominance as a business, its stock had become increasingly “under-owned” by institutional investors and its relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low. We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years…” (Click here to read the full text)

International Data Corporation (IDC) rekindled optimism in smartphone makers like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) with its latest market update. It expects global smartphone shipments to climb by 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, recuperating from two challenging years.

The research firm flagged the popularity of budget Android smartphones in China and emerging markets and the luxury markets’ acceptance of generative artificial intelligence smartphones as potential catalysts.

IDC expects Android to grow nine times faster at 7.1% than Apple iOS due to higher competition in China.

However, IDC highlighted GenAI’s success with the upcoming iPhone 16 and Apple’s capability to forge local AI partnerships in China as potential growth drivers for Apple.

IDC expects the iOS trajectory to improve in 2025 with 4% year-over-year growth courtesy of Apple Intelligence.

IDC expects GenAI smartphones to win an 18% market share by 2024, driven by the premiumization trend.

In 2023, Apple ramped up its China-based suppliers and manufacturing sites and launched a new Apple store in Shanghai, reflecting its keenness in the market.

CEO Tim Cook attended the China Development Forum in Beijing. Apple also discussed integrating Baidu Inc’s (NASDAQ:BIDU) advanced generative AI technology into its devices within China.

Apple stock gained 27% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to Apple through Vanguard Div Appreciation ETF (NYSE:VIG) and iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT).

Investors are on tenterhooks as Jensen Huang’s AI giant is about to release earnings. Gene Munster, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner, said in an interview with CNBC that the broader market can see a pullback if Blackwell-related delays show a wider impact on the AI chips market. The analyst predicted that it’s going to be a “difficult week” for major tech companies.

However, Munster is highly bullish on the broader AI space for the long term.

“I still think that we are in an early innings of a 3 to 5 year tech bull market that is powered by AI, and I think all these big tech companies are going to do well over the next couple of years,” Munster said.

The analyst said that Jensen Huang has indicated in the previous quarters that the demand for AI chips is more than what his company could manage in the short term, and if he reiterates this in the upcoming results, it would give a strong signal to investors about the AI potential.

“There is a lot of awareness about AI but I think the significance of what it’s gonna do is still underappreciated by the market.”

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 184

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a new bull: billionaire Dan Loeb. The founder of the New York-based hedge fund Third Point said in a latest letter to investors that Apple has a significant upside potential due to AI.

“We believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced ‘Apple Intelligence’ suite of AI-enabled smartphone features – the most compelling of which is a next-generation virtual assistant – will start driving meaningful new demand within Apple’s installed base, resulting in accelerating revenue growth on two fronts. First,  iPhone revenue is going to see a marked improvement because Apple Intelligence features will not be backwards-compatible with existing iPhone models, creating the conditions for a forced upgrade cycle. Second, Apple’s App Store is likely to become the primary distribution platform for most new consumer focused AI apps such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (with which Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently announced a partnership). We expect Apple’s claim on the future economics of these apps to be substantial as it exploits its distribution advantage.”

However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Amid rising inflation and increasing competition in the smartphone market, Apple might not be able to come up to the high expectations of strong iPhone upgrade numbers.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption.

Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

2024-08-28T10:05:45+00:00,Five alternatives to Mag 7 stocks if you missed out on Nvidia,"After propelling markets to record highs in the first half of 2024, the mega cap tech companies that have dominated Wall Street are now grappling with the aftermath of a global selloff that has wiped nearly $1tn (£755bn) off their combined market value.

The so-called “Magnificent Seven” — a term inspired by the classic Western film and popularised on Wall Street — includes tech behemoths Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). These companies were instrumental in driving the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gains last year, with a Morgan Stanley report highlighting that these seven companies alone accounted for half of the index's total return.

The combined market capitalisation of the Magnificent Seven exceeds that of the entire stock markets of the UK, Japan, France, China, and Canada combined. However, this group has recently encountered significant setbacks. Six of the seven companies have reported their second-quarter earnings, and the results have fallen short of the lofty expectations set by investors.

Tesla, for instance, saw its earnings plummet by more than 40%, despite surpassing sales forecasts. Amazon’s share price plunged 11% following its earnings announcement. Growing concerns about the health of the US economy also fuelled a wave of selling across global markets.

""Coming into this earnings season, the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks were up against almost impossible expectations of beating perfection,"" Anna Rathbun, chief investment officer at CBiz Investment Advisory Services, said. ""So in some ways, it's not surprising to see some sell-off here.""

There are also cases where the Mag 7 are just too expensive. Nvidia's valuation surged to such heights that it became out of reach for many value investors. Back in July the company decided to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split, when it was trading at around $1,210, to make its stock more accessible to a broader range of investors. It is now trading at around $120 as the countdown continues to its earnings.

The $3.2tn (£2.4tn) chipmaker will set the tone for tech stocks when it reports later on Wednesday, serving as a bellwether for AI spending and other companies' investment into new technologies.

As the AI rally enters a crucial stage, investors are left to consider where to look for alternatives to diversify their portfolio or undervalued stocks that might benefit from artificial intelligence. Here are some companies to have on your radar.

ASML (ASML)

The AI rally has been driven by the need for the world’s most advanced chips. Dutch company ASML manufactures lithography machines essential for producing them.

While not a household name, ASML should be on any investor’s radar who is looking to capitalise on the growth of artificial intelligence.

ASML is virtually the only provider of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are critical to the production of silicon-based microchips. Its clients include semiconductor giants like TSMC (TSM) and Samsung (005930.KS).

When ASML published its quarterly results in July, Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “ASML is further proof that the AI boom still has legs. Demand is soaring for the semiconductor equipment maker.”

Despite a recent share price pullback, the current price of around $920 is more than 20% below analysts' consensus target of $1,194, and the vast majority of analysts still consider the stock a strong buy.

“Companies across countless industries are investing heavily in AI, which means chipmakers have the confidence to build more manufacturing plants,” Coatsworth added. “That feeds into greater demand for ASML’s equipment, which plays a crucial role in the production of computer chips.”

However, weaker-than-expected third-quarter guidance has negatively impacted the stock. Nearly half of ASML’s sales still come from China, making geopolitical risk a significant concern for investors.

ASML is also part of the ""Granolas"" — a group of ""internationally-exposed quality growth compounders"" and Europe’s answer to the Magnificent Seven, according to Goldman Sachs. So named for the combined first initials, which spell Grannnllass, the eleven companies are GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L), Roche (ROG.SW), ASML, Nestle (NESN.SW), Novartis (NOVN.SW), Novo Nordisk (NVO), L'Oreal (OR.PA), LVMH (MC.PA), AstraZeneca (AZN.L), SAP (SAP) and Sanofi (SNY).

Novo Nordisk, another member of the Granolas, is currently Europe’s largest company by market capitalisation and, unlike the Magnificent Seven, is not exposed to the tech sector. This could be an attractive option for those who believe that AI is a bubble or simply want diversification.

The Danish firm makes the weight loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic, which have gained widespread popularity, including among celebrities such as Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and TV personality Oprah Winfrey.

Sam North, market analyst at eToro, told Yahoo Finance UK: ""Novo Nordisk emerges as a standout option in Europe. The Danish pharmaceutical giant has gone from strength to strength over the last few years and is currently the largest stock in Europe by market capitalisation.

“Analysts are optimistic about Novo Nordisk's performance, particularly with its blockbuster weight loss drug, Wegovy. The company reportedly sold 10.4bn Danish kroner (£1.2bn) worth of Wegovy in the first quarter alone, more than doubling its sales from the same period last year.""

He added: “From a technical analysis standpoint, there are a couple of levels that I think act as a good guide of sentiment for the bulls to focus on. The 740 DKK level offers a potential entry point for those looking to buy on dips, while a move above 928 DKK could signal a push towards its previous all-time high. In an environment where timing the market is challenging, Novo Nordisk stands out as a resilient and promising addition to any portfolio.”

Novo Nordisk’s shares have surged around 260% since launching Wegovy in the United States in June 2021. The company’s market value of £455bn now exceeds the size of the entire Danish economy.

Though LVMH has lost its crown as Europe’s largest company to Novo Nordisk, it remains a heavyweight contender.

Despite challenges in the consumer discretionary sector, LVMH has continued to deliver strong profits, with an operating margin of 25.6% in the first half of the year, well above pre-COVID levels. This translated into €10.7bn (£9.02bn/$12bn) in operating profit. Additionally, its free cash flow increased by 74% to €3.13bn, or 7.5% of revenue.

The stock has pulled back on slowing growth and is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22:2.

LVMH's diversified conglomerate model, which includes brands like Tiffany, Dior, Fendi, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, and Sephora, allows it to tap into different luxury segments.

Growth is also likely to improve as inflation and interest rates continue to fall globally.

Returning to the US and the tech sector, Snowflake is well-positioned to benefit from the AI rally. Snowflake’s CEO Frank Slootman said: “There is no AI strategy without a data strategy.”

The company focuses on data management services, collecting and analysing an organisation’s data to deliver insights that help businesses grow. The rise of AI has made this data even more valuable.

The demand for Snowflake’s data management platform has driven strong revenue growth. In its 2024 fiscal year, Snowflake achieved $2.8bn in sales, up 36% from the prior year’s $2.1bn. The company expects its revenue to continue expanding, estimating $3.3bn in sales for fiscal 2025.

However, analysts remain cautious, which could mean the share is currently undervalued.

“Waning optimisation headwinds and emerging new product initiatives should support growth, but investors may need more concrete signals to get on board,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss in a report.

Seven analysts have a ""strong buy"" recommendation for Snowflake’s shares, and 24 rate it as a ""buy"", according to Yahoo Finance data. The market consensus sees the share price trading at $166, higher than the current $118, with $220 as the high range for the stock.

Rolls Royce (RR.L) Rolls Royce has surprised investors under new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic. (REUTERS / Reuters)

It is not part of the Magnificent Seven, it does not list under Europe’s Granola’s and it is part of the FTSE 100 (^FTSE), which Nvidia alone has overtaken in value. So how can Rolls Royce be a Mag 7 alternative?

The company has delivered a total shareholder return of 221% over the past year, matching Nvidia's performance. This surprise achievement reflects growing investor confidence in the turnaround plan laid out by new CEO Tufan Erginbilgic.

His vision for Rolls-Royce is ambitious, aiming to transform the company into a leaner, more profitable enterprise with a bright future. Erginbilgic’s has set out to achieve a dramatic increase in adjusted operating profits from about £250m to between £2.5bn and £2.8bn by 2027.

This growth is underpinned by a strategy to unlock £2bn in working capital savings, primarily through better inventory management. These efficiencies are expected to help the company boost free cash flow from £500m to between £2.8bn and £3.1bn over the next five years.

Since Erginbilgic joined, shares have more than quadrupled to top London’s premier index. That rally is made all the more remarkable given the struggles that gripped Rolls-Royce in the years prior, which included a very close brush with bankruptcy during the pandemic.

The biggest turnaround is expected to happen at the civil aviation business, which accounts for nearly half of group sales. The rest of its revenues are split relative evenly between Rolls-Royce’s defence and power systems divisions.

Erginbilgic believes civil aviation’s adjusted operating margins can be lifted from 2.5% to between 14.5% and 16.5% by 2027. While the improvement looks dramatic, these levels of profitability are comparable to those of some rivals.

The current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of Rolls-Royce stands at 18. While some investors may argue that this valuation isn't cheap, it's also not particularly expensive for a blue-chip company within the FTSE 100.

If I were asked that question, my automatic response would be Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). But I'd be wrong.

Yes, Apple remains Buffett's biggest stock holding. However, it's not his biggest position. Buffett has more money invested in one asset than he does in Apple, American Express, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleumcombined. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Buffett's biggest holding by far

Berkshire Hathaway has big bucks invested in its five largest stock holdings. Its stake in Apple is worth $90.7 billion even after Buffett nearly halved the conglomerate's position in the iPhone maker. Berkshire's stake in AmEx totals close to $38.5 billion. Bank of America is a close third, with Berkshire's position weighing in at roughly $37 billion.

The next largest position in Berkshire's portfolio is Coca-Cola, with Buffett's 400 million shares worth around $28.3 billion. Two oil stocks round out the top six, Chevron and Occidental, with Berkshire's stakes totaling nearly $17.6 billion and $14.6 billion, respectively.

In aggregate, Berkshire's positions in these six stocks are currently valued at nearly $227 billion. That's a lot of money, but it isn't as much as Buffett has invested in another asset.

As of June 30, 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills totaled $238.7 billion. This amount includes $4.1 billion of the conglomerate's $42.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents invested in short-term U.S. Treasuries with maturities of three months or less.

Why does Buffett have so much money in U.S. Treasuries?

Berkshire has a standing policy to keep at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries. However, that threshold is much lower than the current level, which is the highest ever for the conglomerate. Why does Buffett have so much money invested in U.S. Treasuries right now?

Buffett answered this question in his 2021 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. At the time, Berkshire's balance sheet included $120 billion of U.S. Treasuries plus another $24 billion in cash. He wrote then that the large amount was ""a consequence of my failure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.""

That begs the question: What are Buffett's criteria for buying businesses and stocks? He has answered this one in the past, too. In the legendary investor's 2013 letter to Berkshire shareholders, Buffett said he would only invest in businesses and stocks that:

Story continues

He could ""sensibly estimate"" an earnings range for at least five years in the future. Have a price that was reasonable compared to the lower boundary of the estimated earnings range. Are in his ""circle of competence.""

There are undoubtedly lots of stocks for which Buffett can determine sensible future earnings estimates. Plenty of stocks are in his ""circle of competence"" as well. I think Berkshire's huge position in Treasuries is primarily due to stock valuations being too high for him to want to buy -- with a few exceptions, of course.

Should you buy Treasuries, too?

Your investing goals are almost certainly different from Buffett's. But while I doubt most investors will want their largest position to be in U.S. Treasuries, having some of your portfolio in the asset could be wise. Treasuries are a great place to park your cash over the short term while you wait for a potential opportunity to buy stocks at more attractive prices.

I think, though, that some areas of the market offer attractive valuations already. In particular, many small-cap stocks are bargains after lagging well behind large-cap stocks in recent years. With the likelihood that interest rate cuts are on the way, they could perform well going forward.

The company informed the affected employees, who worked across several different teams in Senior Vice President Eddy Cue’s services group, on Tuesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the move isn’t public.

The layoffs included some engineering roles, and the biggest cuts were made to the team responsible for the Apple Books app and Apple Bookstore. There were also layoffs in other services teams, including the one that runs Apple News.

Apple Books has become less of a priority for the company, which doesn’t see it as a major part of its services lineup. The Books app is still expected to get new features over time, according to the people. As for Apple News, the layoffs aren’t a sign that it’s becoming less of a focus, they said.

Layoffs are relatively rare at Apple, though the company has made at least four rounds of reductions in 2024. Earlier this year, it laid off hundreds of workers when it shuttered its self-driving car project as well as an effort to make microLED displays. It also closed down a team in San Diego.

A representative for the Cupertino, California-based company declined to comment on the cutbacks.

Services have generally been a growth engine for Apple in recent years. They accounted for more than 22% of sales in the most recent fiscal year, up from less than 10% a decade ago, and the rise has helped cushion at-times sluggish demand for devices.

Many of the cuts happened in the applications organization that is run by longtime Vice President Roger Rosner. Employees were told they’d have 60 days to find another job within Apple before being terminated. Some of the employees worked across multiple teams, so other areas were tangentially affected as well.

Some of Apple’s Silicon Valley peers are shedding jobs in far greater numbers as they cope with slowing growth and a shift to artificial intelligence. Cisco Systems Inc. is slashing its headcount by about 7%, while Intel Corp. is eliminating more than 15%.

The upcoming presidential election has put affordable housing in the spotlight, but the issue has been top of mind for many businesses for a long time. Big Tech companies have made millionaires out of early employees but have also had an outsized effect on housing prices. As these companies changed the economy in cities like Seattle, San Francisco, and San Jose, they've also started to focus on solving some of the problems they may have helped create.

Amazon's Housing Equity Fund

Amazon's Housing Equity Fund was started in 2021 and has grown to $3.6 billion. It offers funding in the form of below-market loans and grants to developers. The money will be used to renovate and build around 35,000 affordable homes for individuals and families earning moderate to low incomes in three major metros where Amazon has a huge presence: the Puget Sound region, Arlington, Virginia, and Nashville. The fund first launched with $2 billion and created or preserved 21,000 homes in the first three years. The latest tranche of funding, a $1.4 billion pool, is now open for developer applications.

Amazon also launched the Amazon Housing Equity Accelerator, a free, 18-month program to help grow the careers of diverse real estate developers. Amazon has invested $25 million to support the program and graduated 38 developers so far. ""We know housing is a really big challenge for a lot of people, especially in and around expensive metro areas, and we feel strongly that we can help give back to our communities by helping preserve and create thousands of affordable homes,"" said CEO Andy Jassy.

Apple And The Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund

Apple is the major donor behind the Bay Area Housing Innovation Fund, an initiative to make loans for affordable housing projects. The first $50 million investment will fund four projects that will create over 400 homes within the next two years. The first project is Mercy Housing, an affordable development in San Francisco's Mission District offering 145 units of permanent supportive housing for seniors. Another project is planned for Santa Cruz. Apple committed $2.5 billion for affordable housing in California in 2019 and has already deployed $1.6 billion. Developers working with Apple are building or preserving more than 10,000 units statewide. Working with partners that include Housing Trust Silicon Valley, California Housing Finance Agency, and the United Way of Greater Los Angeles, Apple has helped California residents stay housed and finance home purchases.

Alphabet's Housing Efforts

In 2019, Alphabet announced a $1 billion housing initiative. That total included $750 million in land that the company already owned and planned to repurpose. Like Apple, Alphabet, through Google, has worked with Housing Trust Silicon Valley and invested $50 million in the Housing Trust's TECH Fund in 2020. Much of Google's efforts have centered on the San Jose area. The company is currently pursuing the idea of a mixed-use community in the Downtown West area that would have a designated affordable housing development in a former retail location. Google has been at work on this project for a while. Plans got put on pause in 2023, but appear to be back on track.

These aren't the only initiatives from large tech companies. Microsoft committed $750 million back in 2019 and as of 2022, it had deployed $583 million to create and preserve around 9,200 units of housing in the Puget Sound area. In 2019, back when Meta was still Facebook, it announced a $1 billion affordable housing initiative that included $225 million in land donations in Menlo Park, CA, where the company is headquartered. Housing affordability is also part of the efforts of the Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative, the foundation created by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan. In April, the nonprofit opened applications for funds that finance multiple rental and owner-occupied housing projects benefiting low and moderate-income households.

Like many issues in our modern society, a mixture of private and public capital may be necessary to bring about substantive change. While the amount of money that large technology companies are allocating to housing is substantial, with as many as four to seven million units of affordable housing needed, there is still a long way to go.

2024-08-27T19:54:02+00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among Morgan Stanley’s Highest Conviction Stocks,"We recently compiled a list of the Morgan Stanley's Highest Conviction Stocks: Top 20 Stocks To Buy.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Morgan Stanley's other high conviction stocks.

With the second half of 2024 having settled in, the broader economic environment that will determine the future course of the stock market is becoming clearer. While the surge in investor interest surrounding artificial intelligence stocks placed the macroeconomic picture in the background for a while, now, as the second quarter earnings season is nearly over, macroeconomics is coming back into play. Investors are eager to read the mind of Fed chairman Jerome Powell for future interest rate cut decisions and the crystal ball to see what way the economy is heading.

On this front, investment bank Morgan Stanley has been churning out quite a lot of reports to guide investors. One such report came out in July and shared the bank's key themes to focus on during the month. While July is over, this report contains key details that can provide information about what to expect for the rest of the year too. Two of the biggest takeaways from this report cover an economic soft landing and the potential for equities performance to widen.

SEE ALSO 15 Best European AI Stocks According to Morgan Stanley and Best Humanoid Robot Stocks According to Morgan Stanley

On the former front, the bank shared that July ""bolstered the case for a soft landing as inflation has declined and a few major central banks cut rates."" It believes that forward looking data suggests that ""wage growth should continue to slow in the U.S. and Eurozone"" which will eventually contribute to cooling inflation and eventually lower rates to increase the chances of a soft landing. In terms of data, the bank's estimates for 2025 suggest that year over year wage growth could sit at 3% in 2025 for a marked growth over the 2022 peak.

Back then, wage growth percentages as indicated by Indeed postings and the Fed had stood at ~9.4% and ~6.5%, respectively. As an additional positive note, the bank also adds that the US is leading the EU and the UK because of its wage growth of 3% which is less than half of the UK's roughly 7%.

On the latter front, i.e., MS' belief that equities performance can widen, it shares that there ""is ample room for equities performance to broaden, but this requires a cyclical recovery."" What this means is that big tech has accounted for most of the market's returns this year due to the AI hype, and this can spread out to smaller firms but only if the broader economy recovers. Underlying this belief is data for the flagship S&P index's price to earnings ratio, as the bank shares that the 12 month forward P/E ""runs at 21x on a cap-weighted basis but only 16x equal- weighted."" This suggests that the smaller companies have room to catch up with the larger companies, but their performance will only improve if consumer and business spending flourishes during a cyclical uptrend.

Story continues

This potential has led the bank to lament that ""we turned neutral too soon"" as it also cites forward earnings data to support the hypothesis of the bifurcation in valuation. For the Magnificent Seven stocks, the 12 month forward earnings rebased to 100 as of December 2023 sit at a whopping 120 while the estimate for the remaining 493 firms on the S&P index is ~106. However, before you get too optimistic, MS also cautions against investing in small cap stocks. It shares that small cap ""requires economic growth acceleration with lower interest rates, which seems unlikely in the current inflation environment."" Plotting the returns of small caps with bond yields to signify a relationship with interest rates, its data shows that when bond yields were at 1%, small cap relative returns to large caps were 100%. But when the yields soared to ~5.6%, these returns dropped to ~82%.

MS' August report builds on the July themes. It builds on the bearishness surrounding small caps, shifts the focus on the labor market over inflation, and brings real estate into the mix. Reducing wage growth allows the Fed to shift its focus from inflation ""to potential cracks in the labor market,"" says the bank, but it cautions that recession ""indicators such as the Sahm Rule are creeping toward a recessionary threshold based on the rising national unemployment rate."" Its data shows that the 3 month national unemployment average is 0.5% over the previous 12 month low, which rings a warning bell, to say the least. Still bearish on small caps, it adds that while ""recent inflation data and the resulting decline in rates was a lift to small cap, softer economic data may constrain its continued outperformance.""

There is some positivity in the August report, though. The bank shares that commercial real estate, which has been one of the hardest hit sectors from rising rates and shifting trends to remote working, now presents an ""emerging opportunity set."" The analysts outline that commercial real estate valuations ""valuations have become more attractive in the face of higher interest rates and elevated supply,"" adding that they ""expect volumes to pick up this year due to upcoming debt maturities, reinforcing these lower entry points."" Counterintuitively, this optimism is based on depressed valuations as it uses the commercial real estate cap rate. As per MS' data, this rate sat at 9% in March 2024, for nearly a two percentage point lead over retail real estate and a wider three point lead over residential real estate. The bank is also quite impressed with hedge fund performance in 2024 as it commented that the funds ""delivered attractive risk-adjusted performance in the first half of 2024 and their positioning suggests confidence in the opportunities for skill-based returns.""

Our Methodology

To make our list of MS' top stocks, we used its latest 20 top conviction stock ideas and ranked them by the average percentage share price upside to the bank's own share price targets.

For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Share Price Upside: 21%

Number of Hedge Fund Investors In Q2 2024: 184

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's largest technology company in terms of revenue and market capitalization. Its $3.4 trillion valuation is driven by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s bread and butter product, the iPhone, its tight ecosystem that drives complementary and other product sales, and technological and design strengths that focus on aesthetics as well as hardcore engineering such as semiconductor design. For the nine months ending in June, $155 billion of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s $296 billion in revenue was from iPhone sales. This makes the iPhone upgrade cycle a key tenet of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis, as analysts and investors place their faith in strong product design and ecosystem capture making iPhone users stick with the lineup when they choose to upgrade. Another key pillar of the hypothesis is the Services business division which accounted for $72 billion of revenue during the nine month period. Apart from products such as the App Store, Services also include revenue from payments made by Google to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to offer Google's Search on its products, and anti trust action against Google or other legal actions could spell trouble.

Polen Capital mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what it said:

""Apple re-emerged as a top performer in the second quarter. The company reported better-than-feared results in its iPhone segment that quelled concerns over weakness in China. Additionally, the company forecast a return to sales growth and announced a $110 billion stock buyback plan, the largest in U.S. history. Later in the period, at its Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple introduced long-awaited new AI features that spurred some optimism around an upgrade cycle for the iPhone and, more generally, the important role Apple may be able to play in the emerging AI landscape. We continue to study Apple closely, which we previously owned the company for many years during its growth phase, to determine if it is poised for another significant revenue and earnings growth period.""

Overall AAPL ranks 8th on our list of Morgan Stanley's highest conviction stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

2024-08-27T17:50:10+00:00,IDC raises annual global smartphone shipments forecast on GenAI optimism,"(Reuters) - Research firm IDC raised its forecast for full-year global smartphone shipments on Tuesday, citing strong growth in the first half of the year as consumer electronics demand recovers and artificial intelligence features attract buyers.

IDC expects shipments to grow 5.8% to 1.23 billion units in 2024, up from its previous forecast of 4% growth to 1.21 billion units.

WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

In an uncertain economy where price-conscious consumers typically hesitate to make big purchases, the forecast raise suggests that the new AI features might boost demand in key markets like the U.S. and China, which is recovering after a prolonged slump.

KEY QUOTE

""Although GenAI smartphones are relatively new in the market, premium flagships will continue to adopt GenAI features to help separate them from the pack,"" said Anthony Scarsella, research director with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker.

CONTEXT

Apple is set to hold its fall event on Sept. 9 at its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where it is expected to unveil new iPhones, as it looks to reverse a global sales slowdown, particularly in China.

At its developers conference in June, Apple unveiled a series of AI features for its operating system under the name ""Apple Intelligence"".

Earlier this month, Alphabet's Google also announced its new line of Pixel smartphones with deep AI integration.

BY THE NUMBERS

IDC predicts GenAI smartphones will surge 344%, capturing 18% of the market by the end of 2024 as more flagships adopt built-in generative AI features for daily use.

The firm projects Apple's iOS growth trajectory to improve in 2025 with 4% year-over-year growth, thanks to Apple Intelligence.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other trending AI stocks.

The AI industry has been experiencing explosive growth, making it a highly attractive sector for potential investors. According to a report by Bloomberg Intelligence, the global generative AI market was valued at approximately $40 billion in 2022, just before the launch of ChatGPT, and is now expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of more than 40% to reach over $1.3 trillion in size within the next decade. This growth is fueled by the rapid adoption of AI technologies across various industries, including healthcare, finance, retail, and manufacturing, where AI is being leveraged to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and create new revenue streams. For instance, in healthcare, AI-driven diagnostics and personalized medicine are revolutionizing patient care, leading to more accurate and timely treatments. The finance sector is also reaping the benefits of AI through advanced algorithms for fraud detection, risk management, and personalized banking services.

The AI market is not just expanding in terms of applications but also geographically. North America has been a dominant force in AI development, with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon leading the charge. However, Asia-Pacific, particularly China, is rapidly catching up, driven by significant investments and a robust government push toward AI adoption. The Chinese government has an ambitious AI plan aimed to make the country a global leader in AI by 2030, with projections that the AI industry of China could reach $150 billion in size by then. This geographical diversification is crucial for investors looking to tap into different markets and reduce their risk exposure.

Investors should also consider the substantial investments being made in AI startups, which are critical drivers of innovation. According to CB Insights, AI startups raised over $66 billion in funding in 2022, marking a record year despite broader economic uncertainties. This trend is expected to continue as more venture capital firms and corporate investors recognize the potential of AI to disrupt traditional industries. Furthermore, the integration of AI with other emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and quantum computing, is likely to create new opportunities and markets, further driving growth.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The buzz surrounding Apple on Wall Street these days is not related to artificial intelligence, but rather the sale of Apple stock by Wall Street legend Warren Buffett. Even as the firm prepares to debut new M4 processors and Apple Intelligence, hardware and software specifically designed for AI tasks, the Buffett sale has overshadowed the upcoming annual Apple event. Buffett reduced his stake in the firm by half during the second quarter of 2024, latest 13F filings reveal. The timing of this move seems questionable, since Apple continues to show strong iPhone shipments and has the most AI-enabled PC portfolio in the global market.

When it comes to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), even Wall Street analysts seem to be at odds with Buffett. Investment advisory Loop Capital has a Buy rating on the shares with a price target of $300, implying upside potential of a handsome 32%.

But there's a lesser-known character in this story, a man who played a crucial role in Apple's early days yet slipped into the background of history: Ronald Wayne.

Don't Miss:

Don’t miss the real AI boom – here’s how to use just $10 to invest in high growth private tech companies. General Motors and other leaders revealed to be investing in this revolutionary lithium start-up — allowing easy entry by launching at just $9.50/share with a $1,000 minimum.

Wayne was the third co-founder of Apple, a man whose brief stint with the company became a legendary tale of what might have been. He famously sold his 10% stake in the company for just $800 – a decision that, in hindsight, seems almost unimaginable. Today, thanks to Apple's current market value of approximately $3.45 trillion, Wayne’s stake would be worth around $345 billion.

Trending: Here’s the AI-powered startup that turns traders into influencers achieving 12% monthly growth – invest in it at only 10 cents per share.

Ronald Wayne, born in 1934, was already an experienced engineer and entrepreneur when he joined forces with the much younger Jobs and Wozniak in 1976. At 41, Wayne brought maturity and stability to the team, otherwise brimming with youthful energy and ambition. His job was to provide ""adult supervision"" to the startup, manage the mechanical engineering, and handle the necessary paperwork. Wayne was instrumental in drafting the original partnership agreement and even designed Apple's first logo. Despite his significant contributions, Wayne's time with Apple was incredibly short – just 12 days.

So, why did he walk away? Wayne was concerned about the financial risks involved. Jobs had taken out a $15,000 loan to fill an order for The Byte Shop, a retailer with a shaky reputation. As the only one with substantial personal assets (including a house), Wayne feared that the debt would fall on him if the business failed. Jobs and Wozniak, having no real assets then, had little to lose, but Wayne wasn't in the same position. The fear of financial ruin led him to sell his shares to Jobs and Wozniak for that fateful $800.

Trending: Groundbreaking trading app with a ‘Buy-Now-Pay-Later' feature for stocks tackles the $644 billion margin lending market – here’s how to get equity in it with just $100

Looking back, it's easy to see Wayne's decision as a monumental mistake, especially given Apple's incredible success. But Wayne himself has no regrets. He's often said that had he stayed with Apple, the stress would have likely killed him, making him the ""richest man in the graveyard.""

Story continues

Ronald Wayne's story is a sobering reminder of the unpredictable nature of entrepreneurship. While he missed out on becoming one of the richest men in the world, he's at peace with his decision, valuing his well-being over wealth. Today, there's growing recognition of his contributions, with many now acknowledging his role in the birth of Apple.

His legacy, ultimately, isn't defined by the wealth he gave up but by the fact that he was there, right at the beginning, laying the groundwork for one of the most influential companies in history.

Daniel Loeb, the billionaire founder of Third Point, a large hedge fund, is known for his intelligent take on the overall stock market. He publishes his thoughts each quarter in an investor letter that can provide insights for all investors.

Like many investors, Third Point has benefited from the run-up in tech stocks, and Loeb says that the company will continue to invest in those areas. However, Third Point also looks at the physical world. ""In a market consumed with technological disruption, we are focused on finding companies that are difficult to disrupt due to competitive moats, consolidated industry structures, unique products, or capital intensity that deter competitive investment,"" Loeb wrote.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing.

Three Places Loeb And Third Point Are Investing Now

While others, including Warren Buffett, are selling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, Third Point has taken a position. Apple stock is up approximately 21% year to date. Loeb highlighted the power of Apple's device ecosystem. Some critics have said Apple has been too slow to move on artificial intelligence; Loeb sees things differently. He believes Apple Intelligence will increase iPhone sales, which have been lackluster in recent quarters, and turn Apple's app store into the ""primary distribution platform for most new consumer-focused AI apps.""

Third Point added to its position in Corpay (NYSE:CPAY), a stock up over 8% year to date. Corpay is far from a household name, but it is a crucial player in the payments space. Corpay operates a fuel card business that processes fuel purchases by commercial vehicle operators. It also has a strong B2B business payments segment. While Loeb mentioned that the popularity of electric vehicles could have a longer-term impact on a company that facilitates gasoline and diesel payments, he said the company is prepared for the transition. The decline in EV sales may also indicate that the shift to electric vehicles will take much longer than initially anticipated. Loeb believes Corpay can shift so that B2B payments become the growth areas of the business. “We see this as a watershed moment for the stock, which will turn investor focus from the prior driver of Corpay's revenue growth to the next one and will reassure investors that Corpay has many years of 10%+ EPS growth ahead,” he wrote.

The third company that Loeb highlighted is Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:U), a stock up nearly 27% year-to-date. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offers information services and exchange assets across various asset classes, including energy, mortgages, fixed income, rates, and equities. This is a very data-driven business. It currently generates 30% of its revenues from the oil, natural gas, and environmental futures markets. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement generates another 20% of revenue from its mortgage franchise, which has grown since the acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Black Knight. It has over a 50% market share in mortgage origination and mortgage servicing software. The potential is to build a complete platform that services the loan from origination to outcome. This consolidation is occurring as we near what is expected to be the bottom of the mortgage market. As interest rates drop, increasing mortgage applications could be good news for ICE’s mortgage business and stock.

Like many others, Loeb believes a lower-rate environment will increase credit transactions and spur mergers and acquisitions. In addition to equities, Third Point invests in corporate and structured credit, and he sees an opportunity ahead: ""As rates rally and concerns of a recession reemerge, mounting credit issues in public, corporate credit and commercial real estate should present interesting opportunities for us to reinvest amidst the volatility.""

Are You Missing Out On Higher Yields?

The current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.

For example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.

2024-08-27T13:00:15+00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Apple (AAPL) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Over the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share, indicating a change of +8.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2.5% over the last 30 days.

For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.70 points to a change of +9.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.4%.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.55 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Apple.

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

In the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $94.12 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +5.2%. The $390.22 billion and $424.35 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.8% and +8.8%, respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

Apple reported revenues of $85.78 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $1.26 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $84.43 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.59%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.

The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.

Apple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Conclusion

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.

With the belief that this could be a game-changing technology, it makes sense why people want to gain exposure to this trend in their portfolios.

That's also true for the great Warren Buffett, who has historically shied away from making tech investments. Berkshire Hathaway, the massive conglomerate that he runs, has 29% of its public equities portfolio in one monster AI stock.

Continue reading to find out what company this is and if it makes for a smart investment right now.

Apple's advantage

One of Warren Buffett's most successful investments is a recent one. I'm talking about his incredibly lucrative bet on Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker's shares have skyrocketed over the past few years.

The Oracle of Omaha decided to trim his position meaningfully in the three-month period that ended in June. Nonetheless, Apple is still the single-largest position in the conglomerate's portfolio.

Nvidia gets all the attention, as it's the main poster child for the AI boom. But investors shouldn't forget about the already dominant tech titans that have long been at the forefront of digital trends. Apple is one of these businesses.

In typical fashion, the Cupertino-based company was late to the game in terms of revealing its AI strategy. But it certainly made a splash.

Called Apple Intelligence, the overarching objective is simply to make the company's various hardware devices more useful to consumers. Notable features are an upgraded Siri assistant, enhanced writing tools, and the ability to generate images. Newer products with the latest software will have these AI features enabled, which will be integrated with ChatGPT.

Investors might be looking for businesses that can introduce completely new AI-related products and services. But I think this is the wrong way to view things. Instead, companies that already lead their respective industries will likely utilize AI to bolster their current competitive positions.

Here's where Apple has an advantage. It has over 2.2 billion active devices across the globe, which creates unmatched distribution capabilities to release its AI features with immediate adoption. Given that users are locked into the Apple ecosystem, I'm confident the business will be successful with this new initiative.

At the end of the day, though, I still see one main goal with the company's AI push: to sell more iPhones. Apple remains a smartphone enterprise, as 46% of its third-quarter 2024 (ended June 29) revenue was derived from the sale of iPhones. Perhaps Apple Intelligence will encourage more people to switch to the latest models.

Story continues

""I would just say that with Apple Intelligence, we are very excited and about the level of value that we're going to provide to users, we believe that that presents another reason for a compelling upgrade,"" CEO Tim Cook said on the Q3 2024 earnings call.

Should you buy Apple stock?

Apple is one obvious way to bet on the AI trend. It's a competitively advantaged and extremely profitable enterprise. But to be clear, I don't think the stock is a smart buying opportunity today.

As of this writing, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 34. That's a substantial premium to the trailing five- and 10-year averages. Paying such a steep price only makes sense if Apple's growth is set to accelerate in the years ahead. But given that this is a very mature business these days, that's not likely.

The average investor shouldn't blindly follow the actions of the greats, even Warren Buffett. The fact that the investing legend trimmed his position could be a clear sign that he doesn't believe Apple is as compelling of an opportunity anymore. I believe this is the right point of view to have, which means investors should reconsider buying the stock right now.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was down nearly 1% in afterhours trading.

2024-08-26T17:44:57+00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL): A Good Technology Stock To Buy For Long Term,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy for Long Term.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other technology stocks.

An Analysis of the Technology Industry

The technology industry is one of the key drivers of the global economy. According to MGI research, the global technology industry was valued at $8.51 trillion in 2022 and is forecasted to grow at a compound annual rate of 7.75% to reach $11.47 trillion by 2026. In the United States alone the information technology industry drives more than one-third of the national economy.

One of the latest trends in the tech industry has been the increasing investments in artificial intelligence by both tech giants and start-up companies. According to a July 3 report by Reuters, the US venture capital funding surged to $55.6 billion during the second quarter of 2024. The funding surged more than 47% on a quarterly basis and was mainly driven by significant investments in artificial intelligence companies including $6 billion raised by Elon Musk’s xAI.

However, over the past few months, the technology sector has seen a major sell-off due to what analysts call an “AI bubble”. The sell-off initiated with investors raising concerns over return on investment regarding the premium they have been paying as capital expenditure on artificial intelligence. On August 5, CNBC reported that the “Magnificent Seven” US tech companies lost a combined $1 trillion market value at the start of the trading day. As a result, NASDAQ was down 3%, marking the index’s steepest three-week slide in two years.

We recently covered the AI tech bubble in detail in 10 Tech Stocks to Monitor Amid Market Volatility According to Bernstein Analyst. Here’s a glimpse of the article:

“In the past few weeks, a major selloff in the technology sector, mostly over concerns about return on investments amid ballooning capital expenditures on artificial intelligence (AI), has hit the stock market, sending valuations crashing and igniting fears of an AI bubble at the marketplace that might be about to burst. However, Stacy Rasgon, who has covered semiconductor stocks, one of the most prominent sectors in the AI world, for over fifteen years, has advised investors to stay the course, terming fears of a bubble as overblown. Rasgon claims that even though chances of an air pocket, used to refer to stock plunges, are 100%, he is confident the time for them is not now. He pointed to the very real and massive AI data center build as an example, predicting it would go on for a few years, helping push AI stocks higher.”

Michael Landsberg, Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth CIO appeared on a CNBC interview to talk about the AI bubble. He believes that the AI bubble hasn’t popped yet and what we saw recently was a reset of the market, where the market resets out-of-sync factors, and does not mean that the analysts are not positive about AI. He further added that a lot of AI companies have had a great past six months and are growing their earnings. He believes that ultimately earnings drive any stock and as far as AI stocks are concerned their earnings are growing and will continue to grow, thereby increasing the price.

Moreover, Steve Eisman, Neuberger Berman Senior Portfolio Manager appeared on another CNBC interview termed the recent events as a “Psychological Rotation”. He mentioned that this was not a fundamental rotation, which could have been troublesome, rather it is a psychological rotation that will not hold for long. He further mentioned that Artificial intelligence is here to stay for years and he still sees massive growth opportunities for companies investing in AI.

Our Methodology

To compile the list of 10 best technology stocks to buy for the long term we used the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners. We searched for technology stocks and sorted them based on their market capitalization. From these stocks, we selected technology stocks that have been in business for 20 years or more and are expected to stay in business for several decades. Once we had the consolidated list, we ranked the stocks that were the most widely held by institutional investors, as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders for each stock.

Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 184

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) the maker of the famous iPhone is one the best technology stocks to buy for the long term. It was held by 184 hedge funds in the second quarter of 2024, with total stakes worth $124.18 billion. Berkshire Hathaway is the top shareholder of the company with a position worth $84.25 billion.

It is one of the largest companies by market capitalization, which is more than $3.41 trillion as of August 23, 2024. The company has been growing its revenue by 8% and its net income by 10% during the past 10 years. The Q3 2024 of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was also a success story, its revenue grew 5% year-over-year to reach $85.8 billion, whereas, its earnings per share grew 11% during the same time.

The company also achieved record revenues from its Canada, Mexico, France, the UK, Germany, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand markets. Moreover, its service revenue also improved 14% year-over-year to reach an all-time high of $24.2 billion.

Analysts are expecting its earnings to grow by 17% during the year to reach $7, while the broader market average sits at 4%. 47 analysts have a consensus Buy rating on the stock, with their median price target of $250 presenting an upside of 11% from current levels.

Analysts are expecting that investments made in AAPL will pay off big time because of artificial intelligence. Yes, the company has been using AI for a long time as we have seen Siri as its virtual assistant, however, the company is about to scale up its AI game.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has announced plans to launch its Apple intelligence in the upcoming months. Its initial features include a new interface for Siri, the ability to rewrite content in different tones, summarize emails, and other AI accessibility features. Later, the company plans to integrate ChatGPT to further enhance its Apple intelligence for iPhone users.

Here’s the catch: The launch of Apple intelligence will only work on iPhone 15 Pro and the upcoming models thereby leading to an iPhone upgrade supercycle for the company. For context, during the most recent quarter, iPhone sales accounted for around 46% of the net sales. Thus, as expected the upgrade supercycle has the potential to substantially increase the revenue of the company and subsequently boost returns for its investors.

Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

Overall AAPL ranks 5th on our list of the best technology stocks to buy for long term. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The presentation will be held at the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park, the company said on Monday. The theme of the event is, “It’s glowtime.”

Apple had previously been preparing to hold the launch on Sept. 10, people familiar with the matter have said, though it will now be one day sooner. Sept. 10 is the date of the first presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican nominee Donald Trump.

The iPhone 16 will have larger screens on its Pro models and new camera features, such as a dedicated button for taking photos. The company also is rolling out a suite of artificial intelligence tools called Apple Intelligence. Overall, though, the phones won’t be vastly different than last year’s models.

2024-08-26T11:57:44+00:00,Apple Inc. (AAPL): Among The Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors,"We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best American Stocks To Buy For Foreign Investors.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other American stocks.

With August Ending, What Can We Expect From US Markets?

Historically, September is considered to be the worst month for stocks. The S&P 500 index has generally averaged a decline in the month of September for decades, which has resulted in many financial news reporters, such as the Wall Street Journal, dubbing September as a weak month for US stocks. So with August coming to an end, many investors in the US and abroad may be wondering whether now is a good time to pick up US stocks for their portfolios.

While history can often be an accurate indicator of stock performance, this is not always the case. This year may very well be an outlier in the historical trend outlined above, seeing as many financial analysts are expecting the US Federal Reserve to move ahead with a rate cut this September. CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on August 21 highlighted that according to the Fed's recent meeting minutes, it is quite probable that we will be seeing a rate cut this September, which will probably result in stock prices rising and the markets performing better. This is because when a rate cut is announced, consumers and businesses tend to increase their spending and investment, which has a direct and positive impact on stock prices, causing them to rise. As such, if we do see a rate cut next month, investors may actually benefit from investing in American stocks.

How Would a Potential Rate Cut Impact The Markets?

On August 22, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors Managing Partner, joined CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" to discuss the status of the US markets at present. Here's what he had to say:

""The FMOC minutes that came out yesterday showed the Fed staff saying this is a strong labor market, while that jobs report that came out Friday and the revisions that just came out show a lot of jobs disappearing. It's not a stronger market, and I think it gives more ammunition for the Fed to start a cutting cycle, and that's gonna give a lot of life to the economy and to the markets. Especially cyclical stocks and small-cap stocks.""

According to Lee, investors looking to buy into US equities right now would benefit greatly from a rate cut if it does come about in September. A major beneficiary of such a cut would actually be the tech sector. In this regard, Lee said the following:

""I think tech is still in a good place because of AI, and NVIDIA should reinforce that. It's not a demanding multiple, maybe 28x forward earnings, which is, for the best, one of the most important companies in the world, not a high multiple. So, if tech is in a good place, and then we get fed cuts, I think it allows the whole overall market to expand.""

Story continues

Considering the above, US markets may actually be a good place to invest for foreign investors at present, and within these markets, tech may be a good place to start. This is why we've compiled a list of the best American stocks to buy for foreign investors, comprising most tech companies. Our list includes some of the best American tech stocks to buy, alongside some of the top US stocks for foreigners.

Our Methodology

We selected the most popular American stocks among major hedge funds to compile our list, by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the second quarter of 2024. These companies are considered to be the best US stocks to invest in today according to major institutional investors, and should thus be considered by foreign investors looking to buy into American equities.

Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

2024-08-26T11:28:24+00:00,Why Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Dividend Stock According to Warren Buffett?,"We recently compiled a list of the Warren Buffett Dividend Stocks by Sectors and Industries. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other Warren Buffet-approved dividend stocks.

Warren Buffett is a well-known figure in the investment community, and his reputation requires no introduction. He is one of those rare investors whose strategies are closely emulated by countless newcomers to the field. This widespread admiration stems from the fact that Buffett operates in a class of his own. He remains committed to the investment principles he has relied on throughout his career, particularly value investing. The Oracle of Omaha’s lack of enthusiasm for the current AI trend highlights his steadfast dedication to the strategies that have guided his investment approach for decades.

At the Berkshire annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett was asked about AI's potential impact on traditional industries. He responded by acknowledging that he was not knowledgeable about the technology but emphasized that this lack of understanding did not imply he dismissed its existence, importance, or significance in any way. That said, Buffett is also enthusiastic about several other strategies beyond value investing.

Dividend stocks have been a staple in Berkshire's portfolio for a long time, with nearly 93% of the holdings focused on them. The media has often highlighted Buffett's affinity for dividend stocks, particularly because Berkshire Hathaway, his own company, does not pay a dividend. His approach has proven successful, as the investment portfolio managed by Buffett and his team is projected to generate around $6 billion in annual dividend income. Remarkably, $4.36 billion of that income from common and preferred stock dividends comes from just five companies.

Buffett’s approach to dividend investing isn’t driven by chasing the highest yield. Instead, he prioritizes identifying outstanding companies that can maintain and grow their dividends over the long term. He prefers a moderate yield from a stable, successful company over a higher yield from a less reliable and weaker one. If Warren Buffett has a preference for dividends, it’s clear he’s on the right track, given how significantly these stocks have contributed to overall market returns. His love for dividend stocks reflects the significant role these equities have played in contributing to the market's overall returns over the years. Between 1993 and the end of 2022, the S&P 500 grew by 777%. However, when dividends were factored in, the S&P 500 saw an increase of over 1,400% during the same period. This indicates that dividends accounted for more than 20% of the market’s total return during those years.

Buffett carefully monitors the sectors and industries he invests in, which is a core aspect of his investment strategy. By the end of Q2 2024, the finance sector was the largest portion of his portfolio, followed closely by technology, with substantial investments also in basic materials and consumer goods. This article will explore some of the best Warren Buffett dividend stock selections across these different sectors and industries.

Our Methodology:

For this article, we analyzed Berkshire Hathaway's 13F portfolio as of the second quarter of 2024 and picked dividend stocks from the portfolio. We mentioned the sectors and industries these stocks belong to and ranked them in ascending order of the hedge fund's stake in them during Q2 2024.

We also measured hedge fund sentiment around each stock according to Insider Monkey’s database of 912 funds as of Q2 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Berkshire Hathaway’s Stake Value: $84,248,000,000

Sector: Information Technology

Industry: Consumer Electronics

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tops our list of the best Warren Buffett dividend stocks. The hedge fund reduced its massive stake in the tech giant during the second quarter of 2024, which was unexpected given Buffett’s reputation for long-term investing. The fund's AAPL stake was valued at $84.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, indicating that Buffett had sold just over 49% of the tech investment. Despite this reduction, the company remained by far Berkshire's largest stock holding. Buffett had already cut the Apple stake by 13% in the first quarter and mentioned at the Berkshire annual meeting in May that the sales were partly for tax reasons. He suggested that selling ""a little Apple"" this year could benefit Berkshire shareholders in the long run if future US tax policy increases capital gains taxes to address a growing fiscal deficit. The company represented over 30% of the firm's 13F portfolio.

Where Berkshire slashed its AAPL stake, Baron Funds reinitiated its position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) during the second quarter of 2024. The firm highlighted the strengths in the company's business in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“This quarter we re-initiated a position in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a leading technology company known for its innovative consumer electronics products like the iPhone, MacBook, iPad, and Apple Watch. Apple is a leader across its categories and geographies, with a growing installed base that now exceeds 2 billion devices globally. The company’s attached services – including the App Store, iCloud, Apple TV+, Apple Music, and Apple Pay – provide a higher margin, recurring revenue stream that both enhances the value proposition for its hardware products and improves the financial profile. Apple now has well over 1 billion subscribers paying for these services, more than double the number it had just 4 years ago. The increasing services mix has led to healthy operating margin improvement, providing more free cash flow for Apple to reinvest in the business and to distribute to shareholders. Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported strong earnings in its fiscal Q3 2024. The company's revenue for the quarter came in at $85.7 billion, which saw a 4.8% growth from the same period last year. In addition, its cash position was also stable, generating $29 billion in operating cash flow. The company returned $32 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) currently offers a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.44%, as of August 21. In May this year, the company raised its dividend for the 12th consecutive year.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a popular stock among elite funds during Q2 2024, as per Insider Monkey's database. The hedge fund positions in the company jumped to 184 in Q2, from 150 in the previous quarter. The stakes owned by these hedge funds have a collective value of more than $124 billion.

Overall AAPL ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks to buy according to Warren Buffett. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued dividend stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. The Third Point Offshore Fund returned 1.8% net in the second quarter compared to a 4.3% return for the S&P 500 INDEX (TR) and a 2.8% return for the MSCI WORLD INDEX (TR). In the first half of 2024, the Offshore Fund made profits across all strategies, achieving a 9.8% net return. Over the previous 12 months, the fund yielded a 17.0% net return.

Third Point Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

In April, we took a position in Apple, the world’s leading consumer technology franchise, with an ecosystem of 2.2 billion devices spanning a broad array of form factors including smartphones, tablets, laptops, watches, earphones, and smart home devices. Apple excels in most of these device categories, with revenue share of 50-60% in several key markets.

Despite Apple’s dominance as a business, its stock had become increasingly “under-owned” by institutional investors and its relative multiple had compressed toward a multi-year low. We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years...""

2024-08-26T09:42:00+00:00,Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying Up These Stocks Instead,"Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been the biggest winner of the AI boom thus far, but not everyone thinks the good times will last.

In fact, hedge funds continued to reduce their exposure to the popular stock in the second quarter, continuing a trend from the first quarter. In the period, which included Nvidia's reaching an all-time high market cap in June after its stock split, 326 hedge funds trimmed their positions, according to Whale Wisdom, while 264 hedge funds increased their positions.

While many of the hedge fund managers who cut their holdings in Nvidia still hold large stakes in the AI stock, their decisions to reduce their exposure to it shows they think that the stock's biggest gains may be behind it. Let's take a look at a two of the stocks that billionaire investors are buying to replace Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images.

1. Apple

It shouldn't be a big surprise to find Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) on hedge funds' shopping lists. Not only is it the biggest holding in the stock portfolio of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, but it's also the most valuable company in the world and a longtime winner on the stock market.

Apple appeared to be lagging in the AI race, but the company changed that impression when it unveiled its new Apple Intelligence platform, which features AI tools like a writing assistant and image generation, and will soon be available on the most advanced iPhones. The move also underscores Apple's key advantage in AI -- its installed base of more than 2 billion devices, which allows it to put its software and services in front of a vast number of users.

One of the hedge funds that pared back its Nvidia holdings and bought Apple last quarter was GQG Partners, a boutique investment firm based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In the second quarter, GQG sold nearly 58 million Nvidia shares and added 11.3 million shares of Apple. Nvidia remains GQG's biggest holding, but it sold more than 40% of its shares in the GPU maker. Its Apple stake is entirely new.

Ken Griffin's Citadel Advisors, one of the biggest hedge funds in the world, also exchanged some Nvidia stock for Apple in the quarter. It added 2.6 million shares of Apple worth roughly $500 million in the quarter. At the same time, it sold 9.3 million shares of Nvidia, or roughly $1 billion worth, leaving it with just 2.4 million shares. Citadel has additional exposure to Nvidia through options.

2. Lyft

While Apple appears to be a logical choice for hedge fund investors looking to rotate out of Nvidia, Lyft (NASDAQ: LYFT) is more surprising. Shares of the No. 2 ride-sharing company have fallen sharply since its 2019 IPO -- its early valuations were unsustainable, and the pandemic dealt its business a setback as well.

Story continues

However, Lyft now looks primed for a comeback under a new management team that has scaled back spending on incentives and rolled out popular new options such as giving women riders and drivers the ability to match with other women. Revenue jumped 41% year over year to $1.44 billion in the second quarter, and it reported a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profit.

Billionaire investors seem to be taking notice. David Tepper's Appaloosa Management added 7.5 million shares of Lyft in the first quarter, or roughly $100 million. Meanwhile, he dumped nearly all of his Nvidia stake, selling 3.7 million shares to leave the fund with just 690,000 shares of the AI stock.

Griffin's Citadel also added to its stake in Lyft, buying 4.4 million shares of the ride-sharing stock in the quarter, or roughly $50 million.

For a company the size of Lyft -- its market cap is less than $5 billion -- that indicates a considerable amount of bullishness from the professional investing set. Combined, Tepper and Griffin own more than 3% of the stock.

Lyft is a much different company than Apple, but the buys by Griffin and Tepper, as well as the momentum in its turnaround efforts, should give retail investors confidence to buy the stock. There's a lot of upside potential here as its financials continue to improve.

2024-08-26T08:15:00+00:00,Warren Buffett Has 52.6% of Berkshire Hathaway's $312 Billion Portfolio Invested in 3 Phenomenal Stocks,"Warren Buffett is one of the smartest investors around and has been for decades. As CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Buffett offers tons of investment advice and commentary in his annual letters to shareholders and at the conglomerate's annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.

Buffett's advice tends to be straightforward, but one topic that he can sound contradictory on is diversification. He's a staunch advocate of most investors sticking with S&P 500 index funds. He has even directed the executor of his estate to invest 90% of the money he leaves to his wife in an S&P 500 index fund after he passes. Such funds offer a diverse portfolio of stocks representing numerous industries.

And yet, Berkshire Hathaway's $312 billion investment portfolio is heavily concentrated in just a few stocks. Its top three holdings account for nearly 53% of the portfolio's value. On that point, Buffett makes a great analogy: ""If you have LeBron James on your team, don't take him out of the game just to make room for someone else. ... It's crazy to put money into your 20th choice rather than your first choice.""

Here are Buffett's top three choices right now, which combined account for the majority of Berkshire's investment portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.

1. Apple (29%)

Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been one of Berkshire Hathaway's largest equity holdings. Not only did Buffett spend an estimated $37 billion acquiring a stake in Apple from 2016 through 2018, but the stock has appreciated greatly since then.

At one point, it accounted for more than 50% of Berkshire's equity portfolio. Buffett called Apple ""a better business than any we own,"" referencing Berkshire's portfolio of wholly owned companies like Geico and See's Candies. Recently, Buffett trimmed the position over the last three quarters, including a massive sale of nearly half of Berkshire's remaining stake in the second quarter. Still, Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity holding by far, and Buffett expects it to remain the largest position in its portfolio for the foreseeable future.

There's a lot to like about Apple. The company's ecosystem of hardware and services provides stable revenue as customers generally remain extremely loyal to the brand. Its services business provides a nice area of high-margin revenue growth for the business while the stalwart iPhone ensures that cash flow remains high. Significant share buybacks give an additional boost to its earnings per share every year. And when a new growth catalyst comes along, like the potential for a surge in iPhone upgrade rates due to the pending debut of new AI features, it provides a significant bump in earnings.

Story continues

At its current price, the stock trades for around 30 times forward earnings. That's a premium to the S&P 500, but the stock is arguably worth it as significant cash on its balance sheet and robust share buybacks support strong returns for shareholders.

2. American Express (12%)

Buffett, through Berkshire, acquired a substantial stake in American Express(NYSE: AXP) in the mid-1990s, and he hasn't done much with the position since. It's a true buy-and-hold story.

Buffett pointed to the value of his investment in Amex during his 2022 letter to shareholders. The annual dividends paid on Berkshire's original $1.3 billion total investment in the stock climbed from $41 million in 1995 to $302 million that year. More importantly, the stock has grown in step with Berkshire Hathaway, and even faster over the past year and a half. In his 2023 letter to shareholders, he said Berkshire's share of Amex's earnings from the prior year exceeded the $1.3 billion originally invested two decades ago.

On the subject of American Express, he said, the lesson is clear: ""When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it. Patience pays."" Indeed, Berkshire's Amex position is now worth about $37.5 billion.

What separates American Express from other credit card networks is that it issues the cards as well as manages the payment network. That allows it to retain greater control and capture a greater share of the economics of card transactions. That business has treated it extremely well as more and more transactions move from cash to digital payment tools like credit cards. Amex is quickly expanding its network, particularly internationally, where it lags behind its largest rivals, enhancing the network effect of the business.

More recently, Amex has turned to lending as a growth opportunity. Historically, it required charge card balances to be paid in full every month, but now, some of its cards permit users to carry a balance. Its net interest income grew 20% year over year in the second quarter, accounting for 23% of net revenue.

It has also driven revenue growth by increasing its card fees, while still maintaining its popularity with high-value, high-income consumers. That provides additional protection for Amex against economic slowdowns relative to other card issuers and payment networks.

Shares currently trade near an all-time high, but with a forward P/E ratio of 19, the stock still presents good value.

3. Bank of America (11.6%)

Another financial stock sitting near the top of Buffett's roster of all-stars, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) was a more recent addition to the portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway first acquired preferred shares in the bank in 2011, plowing $5 billion into it -- a highly public vote of confidence in the bank at a time when investor sentiment toward it had soured in the wake of the mortgage crisis. Along with the 5% dividend paid by the preferred shares, Buffett received warrants to buy 700 million shares of BofA's common stock anytime over the next decade for $7.14 each.

In 2017, Buffett exercised those warrants because Bank of America raised its quarterly dividend to $0.12 per share, meaning that Berkshire could get more in dividends from the common stock than the preferred shares. So he sold the preferred stock to cover his common stock purchase. Buffett went on to add to the position over the next few years.

Recently though, Berkshire trimmed about 12% of its stake in BofA. The reason was likely the same as the one behind the Apple stock sale. Berkshire currently benefits from favorable corporate tax policies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. It's sitting on massive gains from its common stock shares of BofA, which currently trade around $38.50.

Bank of America struggled during 2022 and 2023 as the Federal Reserve hiked benchmark U.S. interest rates to curb surging inflation. It held a relatively high amount of long-duration bonds on its balance sheet that lost value on paper as those interest rates climbed. That led to a decline in BofA's net interest income as it had to pay higher interest rates on customers' deposits while collecting lower interest rates from pre-2022 bonds. But the worst appears to be behind BofA as interest rate cuts appear to be on the horizon. Management believes that its net interest income reached the bottom of its trough in the second quarter.

Shares currently trade for 1.5 times tangible book value, which is a fair price to pay even as earnings remain under pressure from interest rates. While Buffett sold some Bank of America shares recently, a 12% cut in Berkshire's stake shouldn't be viewed as signaling that anything is wrong with the business.

2024-08-26T07:12:00+00:00,Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 5 Years From Now,"Currently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is atop the throne as the largest company in the world. It leads second-place Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) by $280 billion, but I don't think it will maintain its leadership position.

In the next five years, I think multiple companies will overtake Apple, but two picks are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). These two have a strong case for becoming larger than Apple, but it won't happen overnight.

Why am I bearish on Apple?

First off, let's talk about Apple. In my opinion, Apple is trading so high due to its past performance. If you look at the performance without the name attached, Apple isn't currently that great of an investment. If I approached you with a stock that posted shrinking revenue for five of the last seven quarters, and in the two quarters it delivered growth, the best growth rate was 5%, you'd probably pass. Throw in the fact that this company is trading at 34 times forward earnings, and you'd run for the hills.

But, because Apple is Apple, investors give it a pass. This won't go on forever, and eventually, something will give. This opens up a lane for Alphabet and Amazon to surpass it, as they still have multiple growth catalysts ahead of them.

Cloud computing is a huge part of Amazon's and Alphabet's investment thesis

While many think of Amazon as just an e-commerce channel, it's much more than that. Commerce businesses have notoriously low margins, so Amazon has multiple other divisions that help boost its profits. One of the fastest growing is its advertising services, which has been on fire over the past few years.

Another strong segment is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing offering. AWS is the largest cloud computing business by market share but has recently delivered slightly less growth than its competition. However, AWS' growth has reaccelerated, which is a huge selling point for the stock.

Although AWS makes up 18% of Amazon's revenue, it accounted for 64% of its operating profit in the second quarter. Though Amazon's business is much broader than cloud computing, its cloud services are a massive part of the Amazon investment thesis. With the cloud computing market expected to expand from $680 billion in 2024 to $1.44 trillion in 2029, it has a huge demand wave pushing it.

An investment in Alphabet is also an investment in its advertising business. With ad revenue making up around three-fourths of total revenue, it's a huge part of its business. Many are worried its search engine dominance may come to an end with competitors like OpenAI entering the arena. However, I think these concerns are overblown, as it would require billions of people to change their habits very quickly.

Story continues

I don't see that happening anytime soon, so I'm not concerned about some of the increased competition.

Another bonus for Alphabet is its cloud computing wing, Google Cloud. While Google Cloud isn't as big as AWS, it's still a big part of the growth story, as cloud computing is in huge demand thanks to the AI arms race.

Both Amazon and Alphabet have their primary businesses, but their cloud computing wings are huge reasons to consider buying the stocks. Apple doesn't have the same kind of growth catalysts pushing it, so don't be surprised if either of these two passes up Apple within the next five years.

2024-08-25T14:43:05+00:00,Nvidia earnings highlight a busy end of August: What to know this week,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told investors on Friday ""time has come for policy to adjust.""

In response, stocks finished the week near record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC), the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) all rose more than 1% on the week. The S&P 500 is now within 1% of a record closing high.

But the market's rebound from August lows will be put to the test this week with a highly anticipated earnings release from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA) after the bell on Wednesday.

Earnings from Salesforce (CRM), Best Buy (BBY), Dell (DELL), and Lululemon (LULU) will also be in focus, while a key reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge will highlight the economic calendar.

A done deal

On Friday, Powell made clear to investors that interest rate cuts are coming in September.

But he did not explicitly signal how aggressively the central bank will slash rates as it gets this easing cycle underway.

Powell noted the timing and pace of cuts will ""depend on incoming data,"" and markets quickly moved to fully price in four rate cuts of 0.25% by the end of 2024 on Friday morning after the Fed chair said the central bank has ""ample room"" to maneuver as policy enters its next phase.

With only three Fed meetings left in 2024, the looming question remains when the Fed would cut rates by 0.50% in a single meeting to reach current forecasts.

""We continue to think that if instead the August [jobs] report is weaker than we expect, then a 50bp cut would be likely [on Sept. 18],"" Goldman Sachs' economics team led by Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients.

As of Friday afternoon, markets were pricing in a 38.5% chance the Fed cuts by 50 basis points by the end of its September meeting, up from a roughly 24% chance seen the day prior, per the CME's FedWatch Tool.

Capital Economics' deputy chief markets economist Jonas Goltermann argued the Fed cutting deeper than 0.25% because of weakness in the labor market may not be a welcome sign for investors.

""Investors may reasonably worry that if the FOMC feels the need to front-load policy easing ... it may be because the economy is slowing by more than the still very rosy outlook discounted in equity and credit markets implies,"" Goltermann wrote in a note to clients on Friday.

""As such, it may well be that a 25bp cut in September is in fact the preferable outcome for equity markets.""

While Powell spent a large part of his Friday speech emphasizing the downside risks to the labor market, the Fed will still have its eyes on an important inflation update on Friday.

Story continues

Economists expect annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.7% in July, up from the 2.6% seen in June. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE rose 0.2%, in line with the month-over-month increase seen in June.

Powell said on Friday his confidence has ""grown that inflation is on a sustainable path back to 2%.""

All eyes on Nvidia

With nearly all members of the S&P 500 done reporting earnings, one massive report has been looming: Nvidia.

As has been the case since the chip giant supercharged an AI-driven stock market rally with its earnings report back in May 2023, expectations for Jensen Huang's company are sky-high.

Wall Street expects Nvidia grew earnings by roughly 109% year over year with revenue also jumping 99% compared to the same quarter a year ago. Updates on any potential delays for Nvidia's new Blackwell chip will be in particular focus.

The stock enters the print up roughly 160% year to date.

""We believe modest expectations for Blackwell shipments in FQ3 have been backfilled with higher Hopper bookings,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh wrote in a recent note.""We expect NVDA to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs.""

Vinh, who has a $180 price target on Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday that the stock still looks attractive even after a recent 30% rally.

""Being one of the best-positioned semiconductor companies, obviously levered to one of the strongest product cycles in AI right now, we think it's still attractively valued at these levels,"" Vinh said.

Charles Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment office Omar Aguilar said the release will be a ""very anticipated"" release for the broader market too.

""What I think is going to be expected by the market is to hear what is the outlook for AI and what is the demand for chips going forward as people continue to spend money in AI technologies,"" Aguilar told Yahoo Finance on Friday.

Tech volatility could be 'behind us'

Whipsaw movements in Nvidia and the other ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks have been a feature of the market's recent drawdown and subsequent bounce back.

Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance this week that the back-and-forth action could be primed to settle down.

""I think most of the short-term volatility in [the Magnificent Seven] stocks is behind us,"" Snider said.

The rally in this group — which consists of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA), along with Nvidia — between Aug. 5 and Aug. 19 added more than $1.4 trillion to their collective market cap.

""The trajectory of sales and earnings growth has been resilient, more resilient than a lot of investors feared coming into the second quarter,"" Snider added. ""Valuations are by no means low compared to history, but they're lower than they were several weeks ago, and we won't get another earnings report for a few months now.""

For the first time since the start of 2022, hedge funds trimmed exposure to many Magnificent Seven tech stocks to end the second quarter, according to Snider's recent analysis of securities filings for the end of the second quarter. Amazon and Apple were exceptions.

Snider said this move ""speaks to the anxiety we were hearing from investors heading into the second quarter earnings season.""

He added that investors felt the stocks had benefited from the excitement around AI but also expressed ""some concern that that AI investment boom was coming to an end.""

""In my conversations with investors, including hedge fund clients, there was very clearly excitement at the opportunity to buy some stocks that they already liked at lower valuations given the sell-off,"" Snider said.

Now, after the snapback in tech stocks, investors aren't as convicted as they were when buying the dip in early August. ""I would call sentiment [around megacap tech] cautiously optimistic,"" Snider said.

Nothing like price to change an investor's feelings.

2024-08-25T11:37:10+00:00,Nvidia gets ready to take over the stock market (again),"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:

The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings

Are you ready for the single most important earnings report of 2024?

Interestingly, this company won the award for the single most important earnings report of 2024 (and every quarter in 2023) when it reported three months ago!

I am talking about Nvidia (NVDA). Earnings are out on Aug. 28 after the close of trading.

Every day, I get to the office by 4:20 a.m. and turn on some software we use to track which stories and ticker pages are garnering the most interest from Yahoo Finance readers. Every single day, one of the most actively viewed pages on our platform is for Nvidia.

The world could be on the cusp of an alien attack, and I fancy people will still be hitting refresh on the Nvidia ticker page. Investors have become absolutely obsessed with a company they had never even heard of two years ago.

I can't blame them.

Nvidia's stock is up 170% in the past year. Nvidia's stock is up 3,000% in the past five years.

These are insane gains, the type that lure in the less-experienced investor hoping to retire early.

And Nvidia's story is surprisingly easy to grasp despite the company's incredibly complicated business. Nvidia makes the best artificial intelligence chips in a world being upheaved by AI. Simple. No one is even close to Nvidia in terms of AI chip performance and forward-looking demand.

I do want to caution that the setup on Nvidia going into the quarterly report is a little different this go around. While the Street is staying super bullish on Nvidia heading into the print, they are a touch cautious amid reported shipment delays for Nvidia's powerful new AI chip Blackwell.

There is good reason for the bullishness based on a host of recent signals from earnings reports:

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) just cited strong AI demand when it reported. AMD (AMD) recently lifted its sales for data center chips for the third time in a year. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) cited strong demand for its liquid cooling solutions. Nvidia chip customer Meta (META) just raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024 and 2025 by billions.

""We expect Nvidia to report beat/raise results, in which upside will be driven by strong demand for Hopper GPUs. Given the Blackwell delay, we believe Nvidia will prioritize the ramp of B200 for hyperscalers and has effectively canceled B100, which will be replaced with a lower cost/performance GPU (B200A) targeted at enterprise customers,"" Keybanc analyst John Vinh said in a client note.

Story continues

For Nvidia's report to be embraced, I think investors need to see at least two things:

Nvidia must convey that reported Blackwell shipment delays aren't a structural issue. Nvidia must show strong quarter-over-quarter sales growth in its data center business.

If this happens, it could shake off a few bears and set the table for what EMJ Capital founder and tech investor Eric Jackson told me on the Opening Bid podcast.

""I'm saying [Nvidia's value] could double again between now and the end of the year,"" Jackson said.

To put that in perspective, Jackson thinks Nvidia's market cap could hit $6 trillion by year-end from $3.2 trillion or so currently.

Jackson reasons the company stands to get there by delivering a very, very strong earnings report this week or in November (or both) that shows off continuing demand for H100 and H200 chips while teeing up the potential of its new AI-focused Blackwell chips.

Rest up. It's going to be a busy week ahead.

2024-08-25T09:52:00+00:00,Warren Buffett Just Made His Biggest Stock Sale Ever. Here's What the Tax Bill Could Be.,"Warren Buffett hasn't seen a lot to like in the stock market recently. He's sold more stock than he bought for Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) equity portfolio in each of the last seven quarters. But last quarter Buffett made his biggest stock sale in the history of the company.

Berkshire unloaded 389,368,450 shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Those shares are valued around $88 billion at the time of this writing. Berkshire received less for the shares as Apple traded below its current level throughout the second quarter.

That makes the third straight quarter Buffett sold shares of Apple, but last quarter's sale was by far the largest. He sold 10 million shares in the fourth quarter followed by 116 million shares in the first quarter, and the 389 million in the second quarter.

At Berkshire's most recent shareholder meeting, Buffett said the sales of highly appreciated assets like its Apple investment take advantage of the current tax code. Still, the tax bill will be quite hefty for Berkshire this year. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Here's how big the tax bill could be

Apple shares traded between $165 and $216 during the second quarter. The average closing share price during the period was $186.49. If we assume Buffett received the average share price on the sale, just so we can do some that, that would be proceeds of $72.6 billion.

Berkshire accumulated the bulk of its Apple position between 2016 and 2018, paying an estimated $36.51 per share on a split-adjusted basis. If every single share sold last quarter came from that lot of purchases and sold at the Q2 average, Berkshire Hathaway would have produced a gain around $150 per share for the 389 million shares sold. That's a $58.4 billion gain.

Berkshire also sold a big chunk of Apple shares in the first quarter, when the stock traded for an average price of $181.83. The estimated gain on that sale is $16.9 billion. That would be a total gain of $75 billion on Apple stock sales alone, and we're only halfway through the year.

Using these calculations, at the current federal corporate tax rate of 21%, Berkshire would have to pay Uncle Sam about $15.8 billion out of the proceeds from the stock sale. Nebraska currently charges a corporate tax rate of 6.5%, so Berkshire will have to pay its state government an additional $4.9 billion.

That said, the current tax code saved Berkshire shareholders a lot of money compared to several years ago. The 2017 tax cuts lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Under the old law, Buffett's sale would've cost an additional $10.5 billion. President Joe Biden has proposed a 28% corporate tax rate to go into effect when the 2017 tax cuts expire after next year.

Story continues

How will a massive tax bill impact Berkshire shareholders?

Berkshire Hathaway shareholders may be wondering how this tax expense will impact the company's earnings. The good news for investors is that Berkshire accounts for its tax liability on unrealized capital gains each quarter as a deferred tax expense. In other words, the bulk of the tax on Apple's gains has probably already been accounted for during previous quarters' earnings reports. That's why investors didn't see a sudden surge in tax expenses on Berkshire's second-quarter report.

As a result, earnings won't be affected by the stock sale (other than the missed earnings from any continued rise of Apple's shares). That said, the sale will result in a real cash expenditure, which management warns will impact cash flows. ""Operating cash flows over the remainder of 2024 will be reduced by significant income tax payments derived from taxable gains on disposals of equity securities,"" management wrote in its second-quarter earnings release.

Despite the hefty tax bill, Berkshire has more than enough cash on hand to pay the government. As of the end of June, it held $277 billion in cash and short-term Treasury bills. A measly $20.7 billion in taxes won't change the fact that Buffett has more cash than he has good investment options for Berkshire.

InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!

Apple

What happened? On Monday, MoffettNathanson initiated on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at Neutral with a $211 price target.

*TLDR: MoffettNathanson ponders the question of Apple’s valuation being too high and/or beyond its fair value. The firm further has concern over Apple’s AI potential noting “unclear data on acceptance in Greater China and potential regulatory challenges.”

What’s the full story? MoffettNathanson analysts question whether Apple’s valuation has overshot, noting that the stock price reflects an iPhone upgrade cycle expected to be significantly larger than the 5G cycle of 2021/22. They express skepticism about this assumption and highlight the overlooked regulatory risks associated with Apple’s contract with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for the default search position. While the firm expects Apple to execute its strategy well, they believe the market has already priced in this expectation. The key question remains whether the anticipated upgrade cycle driven by Apple Intelligence will be larger or smaller than expected.

The firm also raises concerns about Apple’s future beyond AI, including the unclear data on Apple’s acceptance in Greater China and potential regulatory challenges that could impact Apple’s competitive ability. Despite a positive bias towards Apple’s AI strategy, MoffettNathanson concludes that the current valuation suggests the market has already accounted for these factors. They recommend waiting for a shake in market confidence before making further investments.

Neutral at MoffettNathanson means “Neutral recommendations are typically within 15% of fair value.”

AMD

What happened? On Tuesday, Edward Jones initiated coverage on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) at Buy without a price target. AMD was also added to Edward Jones Stock Focus List

*TLDR: Edward Jones analysts believe AMD will see significant growth due to rising demand for data-center infrastructure and the integration of Xilinx’s programmable chip products, with a potential $10 billion opportunity. The firm also highlights that the rebounding PC market, driven by AI-enabled PCs, could lead to sustained growth, which is not yet fully reflected in AMD’s current share price.

What’s the full story? Edward Jones analysts believe that AMD is poised for significant growth due to several key factors. The increasing demand for data-center infrastructure is expected to boost sales of AMD’s chips, particularly GPUs and CPUs. Additionally, the acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) has introduced new programmable chip products and expanded AMD’s market reach. The analysts suggest that AMD is still in the early stages of integrating and cross-selling Xilinx and AMD products, with management estimating this opportunity could be worth up to $10 billion.

Story continues

Furthermore, the analysts highlight that the PC market, which has begun to rebound, could see sustained growth driven by AI-enabled PCs, potentially leading to a longer upgrade cycle. They assert that this optimism is not yet fully reflected in AMD’s current share price, indicating potential for further appreciation.

Buy at Edward Jones means “We believe the valuation is attractive and total return potential is above average over the next 3-5 years compared with industry peers.”

BrightView Holdings

What happened? On Wednesday, Jefferies upgraded BrightView Holdings (NYSE:BV) to Buy with a $17 price target.

*TLDR: Jefferies upgrades BV to Buy from Hold, expecting low single-digit revenue growth and record margins, driven by a new CEO’s leadership and significant progress over the past 10 months. The brokerage anticipates margins to expand from ~11% in FY23 to over 13%, supported by cost-cutting, profitable growth, and improved client and employee retention.

What’s the full story? Jefferies has upgraded BrightView from Hold to Buy, anticipating a return to low single-digit percentage revenue growth and record-breaking margins. This optimism is driven by the leadership of a new CEO with an exceptional track record, who has made significant progress at BV over the past 10 months. The brokerage expects margins to expand from approximately 11% in FY2023 to over 13%, supported by the company’s focus on cost-cutting, profitable growth, and improved client and employee retention.

The brokerage’s confidence in BV’s future performance is bolstered by the upgraded management team and the strategic initiatives implemented under the new CEO. These efforts are expected to drive both revenue growth and margin expansion, positioning BV for a strong financial performance in the coming years.

Buy at Jefferies means “Describes securities that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 15% or more within a 12-month period.”

Crocs

What happened? On Thursday, Williams Trading upgraded Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) to Buy with a $163 price target.

*TLDR: Sidney Sweeney’s role as brand ambassador will attract young consumers and boost HEYDUDE’s visibility, increasing FY24 and FY25 revenue estimates to $873 million despite guidance of an 8%-10% decrease. The analysts stress a “clean marketplace” and “data-drive allocation choices” for Crocs/HEYDUDE in order to pressure competitors such as VANS.

What’s the full story? The research team believes that Sidney Sweeney’s addition as brand ambassador/global spokesperson will attract young consumers and bring much-needed attention to the HEYDUDE brand. Williams Trading expects the agreement with Sweeney to last through at least 2025. Consequently, the research team has increased their FY24 and FY25 revenue estimates for HEYDUDE from $859.5 million to $873 million, despite guidance indicating a revenue decrease of 8% to 10% for FY24. They are confident that Crocs’ history of long-term brand marketing driving short-term positive results will begin to manifest at HEYDUDE.

The analysts emphasize the importance of maintaining a clean marketplace and implementing a pull model for both Crocs and HEYDUDE. They stress the need for sales and merchant teams to fully embrace data analytics for allocation and distribution decisions and to stop MAP holidays within core styles and silhouettes. Reviewing the spring '25 product lineup, the team notes that offerings for both brands are becoming more focused. New products like the Crocs Echo Wave Mule and Echo Surge Sneaker, along with the return of the Bae platform clog, are expected to perform well. The introduction of the Wally and Wendy Comf and updated styles from HEYDUDE show promise, provided demand is accurately planned and properly allocated. The increased focus on HEYDUDE may further pressure competitors like Vans and other canvas casual footwear brands in the near term.

Buy at Williams Trading means “The stock’s total return (price appreciation plus dividend yield) is expected to exceed more than 15% over the next 12-month investment horizon.”

Roku

What happened? On Friday, Guggenheim upgraded Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) to Buy with a $75 price target

*TLDR: Monetization is improving. Investors are likely to realize management's efforts to improve ad sales.

What’s the full story? Guggenheim expects investor enthusiasm for Roku to grow leading into the 3Q earnings in November, as the company progresses in broadening video inventory advertising sales via third-party demand-side platforms and improving home screen monetization. This progress is anticipated to bolster confidence in Roku as a unique top-line acceleration story in 2025. The brokerage’s revised rating reflects financial estimates ahead of consensus for 2024 and 2025, and an attractive relative valuation based on a 15% normalized OIBDA margin, which they believe the company will achieve through revenue growth and cost management.

Despite concerns about Roku’s slow leadership response in the connected TV marketplace and competitive pressures in advertising and CTV, Guggenheim believes that strengthened monetization and leadership execution by Roku Media President Charlie Collier and CFO Dan Jedda should bolster growth and disciplined performance over the next three to six months. This is expected to drive further investor enthusiasm and better position the company for long-term outperformance.

Buy at Guggenheim means “Describes stocks that we expect to provide a total return (price appreciation plus yield) of 10% or more within a 12-month period.”

Concerns over Nvidia Blackwell delays ‘overdone,’ says Evercore

Evercore ISI analysts recommend buying Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock ahead of the chipmaker’s upcoming earnings report for the July quarter, saying that recent worries about potential delays in the release of the Blackwell system are “overdone.”

The investment bank emphasizes that demand for Nvidia's systems remains strong, as highlighted by a 20% quarter-on-quarter increase in hyperscale capital expenditure (CapEx) during Q2 2024. Looking forward, CapEx is anticipated to grow by an additional 8% in Q3 and 10% in Q4.

Earlier reports indicated that Nvidia’s much-anticipated Blackwell system, which features its next-generation AI chips, might face delays of up to three months. This news sparked investor concerns over the sustainability of Nvidia's stock rally.

Evercore analysts reviewed past Nvidia product disruptions in 2008, 2022, and 2023, concluding that while a negative announcement could result in a short-term stock drop of 5%-10%, Nvidia has consistently shown resilience in quickly developing alternative solutions.

“Furthermore, should a delay manifest, we believe demand is so strong, particularly at Tier 2 and 3 CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) and enterprises, that current generation Hopper solutions would be purchased even if Blackwell was pushed,” the analysts remarked.

Evercore continues to view Nvidia as its “Top Tectonic Shift in Computing pick,” asserting that the company is well-positioned to capture up to 80% of the value in the parallel processing era. Analysts also project that Nvidia could achieve more than $10 in earnings per share (EPS) by 2030 “and that it could ultimately grow to be 10-15% weighting of the S&P 500 Index.”

They have raised their estimates for Nvidia’s third-quarter and 2024 performance, along with increasing its target price for the stock from $145 to $150.

MoffettNathanson: Apple’s AI potential is already priced in

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is positioned to be a significant player in the AI space, but this potential is already factored into its stock price, MoffettNathanson said in a note to clients.

The firm, which initiated coverage of Apple with a Neutral rating and set a price target of $211 per share, acknowledged Apple's strong AI strategy but noted that the market has already anticipated and priced in these developments.

Story continues

""Apple is poised to win in AI,"" MoffettNathanson analysts said, but cautioned that ""that's exactly what's already priced in.""

They observed that despite earlier concerns about Apple lagging in AI, the market has consistently shown confidence in the company's strategy. This was particularly evident after the World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC), where Apple confirmed much of its AI plans.

""By the time of their June WWDC, the broad strokes of Apple's 'contextual awareness' AI strategy were already well-anticipated by the tech intelligentsia, and hence by the market as well,"" the note states.

MoffettNathanson emphasized that Apple's AI approach leverages the trust of its over one billion users, especially in handling personal data like contacts and emails, which remain exclusively under Apple's control.

The firm also said that Apple's strategy is likely to drive an iPhone upgrade cycle, but the potential impact of this cycle is already reflected in the current stock valuation.

""Apple’s new AI functionality would be presented in service of driving an iPhone upgrade cycle – Apple is, after all, still primarily a hardware provider – as capitalizing on resident inference capabilities would require at least 8 GB of RAM and a neural processor that phones older than the iPhone 15 Pro don’t have,"" they explained.

Edward Jones initiates AMD stock coverage

Earlier in the week, analysts at Edward Jones initiated research coverage of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) with a Buy rating and added the semiconductor giant to its Stock Focus List.

The firm sees multiple catalysts that could drive significant growth for AMD in the coming years.

A key factor behind Edward Jones' optimistic outlook is the rising demand for data center infrastructure, which is expected to propel sales of AMD's graphics processing units (GPUs) and central processing units (CPUs).

The analysts highlighted that ""growing demand for data center infrastructure should help drive accelerating sales"" of these critical products.

Another driver of Edward Jones' bullish stance is AMD's acquisition of Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).

""While the acquisition of Xilinx adds new programmable chip products and end-markets to AMD's business, we believe the company remains in the early innings of cross-selling and integrating Xilinx and AMD products,"" the firm stated.

The integration of Xilinx’s programmable chip products with AMD’s existing offerings is still in its early stages, but Edward Jones sees significant potential for cross-selling opportunities, which management estimates could be worth as much as $10 billion.

In addition, the firm points to the potential for a prolonged upgrade cycle in the PC market driven by AI-enabled PCs, which could further support AMD's growth.

Analysts believe that the positive outlook for AMD is ""not fully reflected in the share price,"" presenting an attractive investment opportunity at current levels.

BofA double downgrades Silicon Motion to Sell

Shares of Silicon Motion Technology (NASDAQ:SIMO) fell Friday after Bank of America analysts issued a double downgrade on the NAND flash controller supplier.

They cut their rating on SIMO stock from Buy to Underperform, citing expectations of limited growth following the upturn in the first half of 2024.

Analysts pointed out that the company’s guidance for the second half already indicates minimal top-line growth compared to Q2 2024. Their updated analysis also suggests low growth in 2025 for sales, operating profit (OP), and earnings per share (EPS).

""A key reason is likely the low exposure to AI and enterprise SSD, areas more dominated by Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and SK Hynix, respectively,” analysts wrote.

BofA has also reduced its EPS estimates for the second half of 2024 and 2025 by approximately 20%, driven by lower revenue and operating margin assumptions compared to their earlier forecasts.

The investment bank highlighted that SIMO’s revenue primarily comes from “controller IC chips” for NAND products, setting it apart from its competitor, Phison Electronics.

Baidu downgraded at Bernstein on share pressure expectations

Bernstein analysts on Friday downgraded Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) from Outperform to Market Perform following the company's latest earnings report and cut their price target from $130 to $97.

The analysts foresee the stock trading sideways due to increasing disruption and reduced clarity on future prospects.

""We expect more disruption to the near-term Search results and any limited signs of success in next few quarters (that would have allowed investors to look through to the longer term),"" they noted.

The firm also lowered its Search growth expectations by 5 percentage points for the second half of 2024 and by 3 percentage points for 2025, currently valuing the stock on a bearish outlook without factoring in any potential gains from AI Search initiatives.

""AI Cloud and Robotaxi are positive, but without Search showing a revival, we expect that shares will remain under pressure,"" Bernstein analysts added.

2024-08-24T18:26:25+00:00,Here’s Why Wall Street is Excited About Apple’s (AAPL) Upcoming New iPhone Event in September,"We recently published a list of Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.

AI stocks have pulled back considerably over the past few weeks and analysts believe this is exactly the healthy correction long-term investors were looking for. According to Bloomberg, Rob Sluymer, technical strategist at RBC Wealth Management, said that AI stocks have stabilized at levels they can sustain for the rest of the year. The analyst said technical indicators now show AI stocks have gone from overbought to oversold territory.

“Now that positions have been unwound, there’s an opportunity for traders to take positions,” Sluymer reportedly said.

Many others agree with Sluymer. Dan Ives of Wedbush reiterated his view that we are still in the early stages of the AI bull market in a latest program on CNBC.

“If you look at what we’ve seen from AI revolution to broader tech, it’s been strong from an earnings perspective. And the growth scare that we saw, it’s just a bump in the road to what I believe is the fourth industrial revolution playing out,” Ives said.

For this article, we picked up 10 AI stocks that are making waves on the back of latest earnings, analyst ratings or important industry news. With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?

Pixabay/Public DomainIs Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Trending AI Stock on Latest Analyst Ratings and News?

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 184

Morgan Stanley said in a new report that Apple’s iPhone 15 production was stronger than expected in July, with growing momentum leading up to the iPhone 16 launch. Analysts, led by Erik Woodring, reported that their checks from the Greater China Tech Hardware team showed iPhone builds in July surpassed initial expectations, prompting an upward revision of September quarter iPhone builds to 54 million units, an 8% increase year-over-year and 2 million units higher than previously forecasted.

While the real test will be early October’s iPhone sales, the analysts noted that momentum appears to be building as the iPhone 16 launch approaches. The increase for the September quarter reflects the continued strength of the iPhone 15 late in its cycle, with no changes to the production of other iPhone models. However, it’s unclear if this trend is driven by anticipation for Apple Intelligence or other factors.

Story continues

Baird analyst William Power said in a note that he estimates a whopping 95% of iPhones in the world will need an upgrade at “some point” to take advantage of Apple Intelligence.  The analyst mentioned lower upgrade rates at AT&T and Verizon, suggesting consumers might be waiting for AI-integrated smartphones. Based on this catalyst, the analyst upped his fiscal 2025 iPhone estimates by about 20 million units, now projecting iPhone revenue to reach $216.1 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, surpassing the consensus estimate of 6% growth. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is expected to generate $418.1 billion in full-year revenue and $7.30 per share in earnings, up from previous forecasts of $394.6 billion and $6.73 per share.

However, the assumption that we will see a huge upgrade cycle of iPhone just because of AI is big and comes with a lot of risks. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a forward PE multiple of around 35x, well above its 5-year average of nearly 27x. Its expected EPS forward long-term growth rate of 10.39% does not justify its valuation, especially with the iPhone upgrade cycle assumption. Adjusting for this growth results in a forward PEG ratio of 3.33, significantly higher than its 5-year average of 2.38.

Wedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) also contributed to performance after unveiling its AI strategy to its software developers. The Company has been at the forefront of proprietary computer processor development for over a decade. Given the compute-intensive nature of AI applications, Apple is well-situated to develop a suite of compelling, consumer-friendly AI services that are also cost-effective. While revenue growth has been relatively flat post-Covid-19, we expect Apple’s AI value proposition will be compelling enough for consumers to continue growing their engagement in the Apple ecosystem over the next several years.”

Overall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 2nd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

2024-08-24T18:00:00+00:00,"Up 69% in 2024, This Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stock Could Keep Soaring","Semiconductor specialist Cirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) may not be a household name like some of its industry peers, but the company has done impressively well on the market so far this year with gains of 69% as of this writing.

Cirrus, which is known for supplying chips for Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) products, has outpaced the broader Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index's gains of 10% by a big margin. The good news is that Cirrus' outstanding growth is here to stay, and the company could finish the year strongly thanks to its largest customer. What's more, the arrival of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled smartphones is likely to unlock a massive long-term growth opportunity for Cirrus Logic.

Let's take a closer look at the reasons why investors should consider buying Cirrus Logic stock hand over fist before it's too late.

Cirrus Logic's recent results point toward a bright future

Cirrus Logic released fiscal 2025 first-quarter results (for the three months ended June 29) on Aug. 6. The company's revenue increased 18% year over year to $374 million and was well ahead of the consensus estimate of $318 million. What's more, Cirrus' adjusted earnings jumped a solid 67% year over year to $1.12 per share, crushing Wall Street's $0.61 per share estimate.

The positive news didn't end here, as Cirrus expects its fiscal Q2 revenue to land between $490 million and $550 million. The midpoint of the guidance range stands at $520 million, and that's well above the Wall Street estimate of $485 million. Cirrus clocked revenue of $481 million in the same quarter last year, indicating that its top line is on track to increase by 8% on a year-over-year basis.

Cirrus' top line could land closer to the higher end of its guidance range thanks to its largest customer, Apple, which accounted for a whopping 88% of its top line last quarter. Cirrus management pointed out on the recent earnings conference call that its revenue exceeded the top end of its original guidance range thanks to ""stronger than expected shipments into smartphones.""

Because Apple is Cirrus' largest customer, the stronger-than-expected performance means that Cirrus got more orders for its chips last quarter. That's not surprising, as Apple seems to be preparing for an aggressive rollout of its next-generation iPhones that are all set to support generative AI features.

Apple's rumored iPhone 16 is expected to hit the market next month and the tech giant is expected to ship 90 million units of its updated smartphone lineup this year. That would be a 10% increase over last year. But at the same time, supply chain reports indicate that Apple is stocking up on 120 million display panels, suggesting that it may end up manufacturing more units than what the market is currently anticipating.

Story continues

If that's indeed the case, Cirrus Logic's growth in the current quarter is likely to exceed expectations once again. But more importantly, the integration of the Apple Intelligence suite of generative AI features into the tech giant's upcoming smartphones is expected to trigger a solid upgrade cycle. Apple's smartphone shipments are expected to increase by 10% in fiscal years 2025 and 2026, according to JPMorgan's estimates.

Cirrus is expected to land more dollar content in the next generation of iPhones, which means that it should be able to receive more revenue from each unit of the iPhone that Apple produces. So, the stage seems set for Cirrus Logic to end the year strongly, and it should be able to sustain its newly found momentum in the future as well thanks to Apple's entry into the AI smartphone market, a space that's currently in its early phases of growth.

A couple more reasons to buy the stock

Analysts have been quick to raise their earnings growth expectations for Cirrus Logic, as is evident from the chart below. CRUS EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart

Cirrus Logic finished fiscal 2024 (ended on March 30) with non-GAAP earnings of $6.59 per share. The above chart tells us that analysts weren't expecting an increase in Cirrus' earnings in the current fiscal year, but that has changed of late. Additionally, the company's bottom-line growth forecast for the next fiscal year points toward an improvement in its growth rate.

However, if Apple indeed decides to ramp up the production of its upcoming iPhones and Cirrus ends up supplying more content to the tech giant, there is a good chance of Cirrus' earnings easily outpacing analysts' expectations going forward.

That's why now would be a good time for investors to buy this semiconductor stock. It's trading at just 26 times trailing earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's earnings multiple of 31. And the AI-driven growth in the smartphone market and Cirrus' tight relationship with one of the largest players in this space could lead to better-than-expected growth going forward.

2024-08-24T13:41:11+00:00,"If You Bought 1 Share of Apple at Its IPO, Here's How Many Shares You Would Own Now","Few stocks boast a pedigree as impressive as Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL). Not only is the consumer technology giant the first publicly traded outfit to reach a trillion-dollar market cap, it's also often the world's most profitable company. It has earned its status as an investor favorite.

Apple's stock has split several times since its initial public offering back in 1980, of course. It essentially had to, in order to accommodate the organization's incredible growth.

And that raises a curious question: If you bought one share of Apple at its IPO, how many would you own now?

Apple's stock-split history (and IPO price recalculation)

Apple's stock has been split five times since going public in December 1980. The first was 1987's 2-for-1 split, followed by another 2-for-1 split in mid-2000. The next split came in early 2005...another 2-for-1 deal.

Then the party really started. Following the explosive revenue growth driven by 2007's debut of the iPhone, Apple shares saw a 7-for-1 split in mid-2014 and underwent a 4-for-1 split again in mid-2020.

Crunching the numbers, one share of Apple back in 1980 would have become 224 shares today. Adjusting for all of these splits, the stock's IPO price of $22 per share is effectively dialed back to $0.10.

Apple is an exception to the norm, but...

Apple's is an extremely unusual case, of course. Most stocks don't need to be split as much as this one's been.

Nevertheless, not every stock needs to do as well from its inception to make you very, very wealthy. One or two of these mega-winners will do the trick. The challenge is just figuring out which companies have true long-term growth potential and which ones don't. For every winner like Apple, there seems to be a handful of disappointing names like Blue Apron or Groupon. Take your shots, but be discerning and realistic as well.

Environmental, Social, and Governance

July 2024 broke the 175-year record reaching unprecedented levels of global temperatures. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2024 is likely to be the hottest year on record, beating 2023 which was previously the hottest. This presents a stark reminder that the accumulation of greenhouse gases in our environment is leading to global warming and is changing the climate.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) is a framework used to assess corporate performance across key factors regarding the environment, society, and corporate governance. It is becoming crucial for businesses seeking long-term success and circularity. KPMG highlights that companies must integrate ESG into their core strategies to excel sustainably. As regulations become more stringent, companies face higher pressure to improve transparency and accountability in their ESG practices. For instance, the EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive, which came into existence in January 2023, requires all large and publicly listed companies to reveal risks and opportunities associated with social and environmental issues and their impact on the environment and people.

Corporate's Sustainable Performance

Greenhouse gases are on the rise despite global pledges to reduce them. Climate crises are escalating continuously, but the progress toward carbon neutrality is rather sluggish. However, there seems to be some progress as corporate leaders are increasing their investments in sustainable solutions signifying their commitment to green transition, according to the 2024 report by Corporate Knights.

While many companies, particularly in the fossil fuel and banking sectors, remain immune to major changes, the leaders are doubling down on sustainability. The top-ranked firms in the 2024 Global 100 allocated 55% of their investments to sustainable projects, up from 47% the previous year. The global 100 companies are investing more in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable solutions compared to the broader publicly listed companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Moreover, these companies earned 51% of their revenues from sustainable sources, higher than the 16% average. Sustainable investments play a pivotal role in the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Apple's Commitment to Sustainable Growth

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) not only leads the tech world but is also a frontrunner in sustainability. The iPhone maker reached carbon neutrality in 2020, paving the way for future sustainability goals for companies. Since 2015, the company has reduced its emissions by more than 55% while growing its revenue by 64% at the same time. It promotes the adoption of renewable energy and material circularity by decarbonizing its supply chain. Its commitment to sustainability and eco-friendly practices is evident by its significant efforts to make over 320 suppliers commit to 100% renewable energy consumption for Apple products. It invests heavily in renewable energy and aims to reach 100% clean electricity by 2030. It pledges to match every watt of electricity associated with product use by customers with its renewable energy investments.

The tech leader has also made significant investments in carbon sequestration and removal projects. It aims to invest up to $200 million and remove at least 1 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has supported more than 18 gigawatts of clean energy and delivered billions of gallons of water benefits. Its renewable energy investments have generated over 16.5 gigawatts of clean energy in its supply chain, avoiding more than 18.5 million metric tonnes of carbon emissions. Its conservation efforts have led to 76 billion gallons of water saving since 2013.

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) commitment to sustainability and ESG positions it as a leader in the industry, for other companies to follow suit. It boasts a robust ecosystem of products and services, with over 2 billion installed devices. The company is poised for growth as its attached services such as iCloud, App Store, and Apple Music get adopted more widely. This interconnectedness creates a loyal and engaged clientele, fueling consistent demand. Moreover, its new iPhone 16 series is braced for further growth driven by AI capabilities. Investors believe that the latest satellite connectivity in iMessage will majorly drive iPhone sales.

The ability of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to leverage technological dynamics and ensure sustainable production practices solidifies its commitment to innovation. Baron Opportunity Fund said the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:

""Throughout its 48-year history, Apple has successfully navigated and capitalized on major technological shifts, from PCs to mobile to cloud computing. We believe the company’s leading brand and device ecosystem position it to do equally well in the AI age, and this was the driver of our decision to re-invest. “Apple Intelligence” – the AI strategy unveiled at Apple’s recent Worldwide Developer Conference – leverages on[1]device AI and integrations with tools like ChatGPT to enhance user experiences across its ecosystem. The AI suite enables users to create new images, summarize and generate text, and use Siri to perform actions across their mobile applications, all while maintaining user privacy and security. We think Apple Intelligence can drive accelerated product upgrade cycles and higher demand for Apple services. The combination of growth re-acceleration, increasing services contribution, and thoughtful capital allocation should continue driving long-term shareholder value.”

While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

2024-08-23T19:08:36+00:00,"Apple targets Sept. 10 debut for new iPhones, AirPods and watches, Bloomberg News reports","(Reuters) - Apple is planning its biggest product launch event of the year on Sept. 10, during which it will unveil the latest iPhones, watches and AirPods, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the situation.

The company is making preparations for that date, even though the timing has not yet been announced, following which the phones will go on sale on Sept. 20, in line with Apple's typical approach in recent years, the report said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Analysts see a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series and Apple is expected to launch what they call the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone. It includes artificial intelligence features and comes at a time when rivals such as Samsung have been quicker to roll out similar services.

The new launches come as Apple forecasts more gains, betting on AI to attract buyers even as its overall China business disappointed in the third quarter.

Sales in Apple's third-largest market China declined 6.5%, wider than expectations of a drop of 2.4%, according to Visible Alpha.

During its annual developer conference in June, Apple unveiled a long-awaited AI strategy, integrating its new ""Apple Intelligence"" technology across its suite of apps, including Siri and bringing OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT to its devices.

Apple still remains overly reliant on sales of the iPhone and some analysts said any boost from the new AI features was unlikely to materialize in the short term.

Though the timing hasn’t yet been announced, the company is making preparations for that date, which falls on a Tuesday, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. The unveiling will be followed by the phones going on sale Sept. 20, in line with Apple’s typical approach in recent years.

A representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.

The launch is a critical one for Apple, which has suffered sluggish sales of its smartphones and wearable devices in recent quarters. A Sept. 20 release of the new iPhone 16 would mean some of the device’s revenue is recorded in the current period — Apple’s fiscal fourth quarter — when the company expects sales to grow about 5% from a year earlier.

A bigger chunk of sales will come the following quarter, which coincides with the holiday season. Analysts have predicted that revenue will climb 7% to $128.4 billion in that period.

The iPhone 16 will have larger screens on its Pro models and new camera features, such as a dedicated button for snapping photos. The company also is rolling out a suite of artificial intelligence tools called Apple Intelligence. Overall, though, the phones won’t be vastly different than last year’s models.

Apple’s wearable devices, meanwhile, are due for bigger changes. The Apple Watch Series 10 models will be thinner but include larger screens. And Apple is revamping its AirPods lineup with new low-end and mid-tier versions. For the first time, the company will offer noise cancellation on its mid-level AirPods, and the entry-level model is getting updated for the first time since 2019.

The company is also planning to begin transitioning its Macs over to M4 processors later this year, but Mac updates typically don’t arrive until about a month after the annual iPhone launch.

To that end, the company has ramped up testing of four new Mac models to ensure compatibility with third-party applications, according to developer test logs seen by Bloomberg News. That’s a key step prior to launching the new machines. The Macs that appeared are labeled with the identifiers “16,1,” “16,2,” “16,3” and “16,10.”

Story continues

They all represent models with base-level versions of the M4 chip. Three of the Macs have 10 total cores in their central processing units, or CPUs, while one low-end version includes eight total cores — a measure of performance. The versions with 10-core CPUs also have 10-core GPUs, or graphics engines. The model with an eight-core CPU, meanwhile, has an eight-core graphics engine. They all have either 16 or 32 gigabytes of memory.

The 10-core CPU has the same specifications as the M4 processor in the iPad Pro, including four high-performance parts and six cores focused on efficiency. But the fourth chip seen in the developer logs only includes eight total cores, split between four high-performance parts and four efficiency cores.

Bloomberg News has reported that a smaller Mac mini, new MacBook Pros and updated iMacs with M4 chips are coming later this year.

The flagship Offshore Fund rose 1.8% in the second quarter, trailing the S&P 500 Index’s 4.3% gain on a total return basis in the same timeframe. It’s a similar story to the first quarter, when the fund also trailed the broader market despite having nearly half of the equity portfolio in companies linked to artificial intelligence.

The fund added to its AI bid in the second quarter, picking up shares of the Magnificent Seven’s Apple Inc. The fund took a position in April, when it saw the iPhone maker as under-owned by institutional investors with a compressed multiple.

“We believe that this was due to several years of stagnant earnings growth, exacerbated by more recent fears that Apple may turn out to be an AI loser. Our research led us to a different conclusion: we believe AI-related demand could drive a step change improvement in Apple’s revenue and earnings over the next few years,” Third Point wrote.

In the second quarter, hedge funds overall trimmed positions in most of the so-called Magnificent Seven mega-caps, with the exception of Apple Inc. and Amazon.com. The iPhone maker saw the biggest increase in hedge fund purchases by market value in the three months through the end of June, with an aggregated net buy of more than 8.5 million shares, according to Bloomberg analysis of 13F filings.

“In a market consumed with technological disruption, we are focused on finding companies that are difficult to disrupt due to competitive moats, consolidated industry structures, unique products, or capital intensity that deter competitive investment,” Third Point wrote in the letter, saying that while the market narrative is dominated by the Magnificent Seven, they see “even more reason” to add other names to the portfolio.

Positions in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Vistra Corp. rounded out the top five performers during the quarter, the letter said. The fund also added to positions Corpay Inc., Intercontinental Exchange Inc. and London Stock Exchange Group PLC.

Story continues

The top five negative contributors for the quarter were Corpay, Bath & Body Works Inc., Advance Auto Parts Inc., Ferguson PLC and Airbus SE, the letter said.

Stocks have whipsawed since the end of the second quarter. Investors rotated out of large companies in mid-July in favor of smaller and riskier sectors. In recent weeks, that’s reversed, with big tech stocks rebounding and the S&P 500 back near all-time highs.

Third Point expects that volatility will continue through year-end, and said it’s adjusted its portfolio accordingly. The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, is trading around 16 after jumping as high as 65 earlier this month.

“We modified certain exposures with this scenario in mind and worked quickly to mitigate losses during the downdraft,” the fund wrote in the letter. “We are eager buyers of dislocated securities, particularly in credit, should we see further turmoil.”

2024-08-23T13:45:00+00:00,Warren Buffett's Biggest Bets in 2024: 40% of Berkshire Hathaway's $276.9 Billion Stock Portfolio Is Held in Just 2 Stocks,"With a market capitalization of more than $950 billion, Berkshire Hathaway ranks as the world's eighth-largest company. Led by CEO and world-famous investor Warren Buffett, the company has delivered incredible returns for its long-term shareholders and continues to be massively influential in the investing world.

Notably, the Oracle of Omaha has never been much of a fan of portfolio diversification and has instead preferred to weight Berkshire's stock holdings heavily toward a small number of high-conviction investments. But Buffett and Berkshire have actually been making some dramatic moves lately, and the balance of the company's portfolio has shifted in some big ways.

Let's take a look at two of the stocks where he's most invested in now. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Despite big changes, this is still Buffett's biggest bet

Keith Noonan (Apple): Berkshire Hathaway shocked the world with its recent 13F filing. With the disclosure report it submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this month, the investment conglomerate revealed that it had sold more than 389 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock. The move reduced Berkshire's total investment in the tech giant by 49%, and immediately raised concerns that Buffett was losing faith in the tech leader.

On the other hand, Apple is still Berkshire Hathaway's biggest stock investment by far. Even after the sell-off, the iPhone company's stock still accounts for roughly 28.8% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio -- more than three times larger than its second-biggest position.

While Buffett has argued against diversification in the past, it's not hard to see why his company opted to reduce its exposure to the tech giant. At its concentration and valuation peak, Apple accounted for more than half of Berkshire's total stock portfolio.

The investment has been a massive winner for the Oracle of Omaha's company, and the recent stock sale has generated enviable profits. But the question of whether Berkshire will continue to take profits on its Apple investment will likely remain a hotly contested issue until Buffett's company publishes its next 13F filing.

Buffett has previously described Apple as ""probably the best business"" he knows of, but there are some big questions about what comes next for the mobile leader. For starters, it remains to be seen whether Apple will be able to deliver big wins in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Investors and analysts are also wondering whether the company can serve up major new wins in mobile and other hardware categories that are capable of driving big growth.

Story continues

Berkshire's moves to trim its position in Apple stand out among this year's most high-profile moves for institutional investors. But while Buffett has reduced his company's exposure to the mobile leader, it seems like he's still bullish on the stock overall.

The classic, forever Buffett stock

Jennifer Saibil (American Express): There are two stocks Warren Buffett has repeatedly said he would never sell: Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO), his longest-held stock, and American Express(NYSE: AXP), his second-longest.

Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), though, was his second-largest position for a long time. Recently, after Buffett sold a chunk of BofA and did some other reallocation of his portfolio, American Express has slid into that slot. It accounts for 12.2% of Berkshire's total equity holdings as of this writing.

American Express is a great example of the classic Buffett stock. For starters, it trades at less than 19 times trailing 12-month sales. That's well below the average S&P 500 price-to-earnings ratio of 27. Buffett loves undervalued stocks, and as long as American Express stock trades at a low valuation, he's likely to stick with it.

It has an established, distinctive model. It's different than credit card networks Visa(NYSE: V) and Mastercard(NYSE: MA) in a few important ways. It's a closed-loop system, which means that it acts as its own bank and doesn't rely on third-party relationships to fund the credit it provides shoppers to use when they spend. Since it has its own bank, it has an expanded set of services that give it more ways to make money. Buffett loves companies that have a varied set of earnings streams. He also loves bank stocks, since they tend to have lots of cash, which is the anchor of a long-term viable company.

American Express has a fee model. Its loyal cardholders pay annual fees for the privilege of using most of the company's cards, which come with a slew of perks. It's also known for its top rewards program, which keeps cardholders paying year after year and attracts new ones.

American Express has successfully refreshed its image and most of its cards to appeal to a younger, affluent cohort, and they have a long runway of spending ahead. The niche, upscale target market gives American Express a moat against challengers, as well as resilience under pressure.

That's another way American Express fits into the Buffett model. It plays a large role in the development of the economy, and cardmembers rely on it for necessities and luxuries. Expect American Express to keep up its good work and keep providing value for Buffett and other shareholders.

In the tech sector, AI darling Nvidia is expected to offer a glimpse into the ongoing impact of the artificial intelligence (AI) hype on the semiconductor industry, potentially revealing whether enthusiasm for AI is translating into tangible growth.

Meanwhile in London, financial services firm Prudential will show investors if it has managed to turn around its performance. Shares in the company have slumped amid less than stellar performance of the Hong Kong and China economies.

CrowdStrike will also report its results in the cybersecurity arena, with investors eager to see how the company behind the recent global outage is performing.

In the sneaker fashion world, Foot Locker is seeing analysts upgrading its stock ahead of earnings but Wall Street still expects a quarterly loss.

Here's what to look out for:

Nvidia (NVDA) — Reports second-quarter results on Wednesday 28 August

All eyes will be on Nvidia (NVDA) next week, as the chip giant at the heart of the AI boom, is set to release its second-quarter results on 28 August.

Not only does Nvidia hold an 80% to 95% share of the market for high-powered AI chips, according to Reuters, but it is also the world’s third-largest company by market capitalisation at $3.04tn (£2.31tn), having briefly held the top spot back in June.

The AI darling is the single best performer in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index and a leading member of the Philadelphia Semiconductor index — known as the SOX (SOX=F) — point out AJ Bell’s head of financial analysis Danni Hewson and Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst for the platform.

Nvidia is also part of the so-called 'Magnificent Seven', which alongside other tech heavyweights including Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), is a group of stocks that make up more than a third of the S&P 500’s stock market value and a fifth of the FTSE All-World (AW01.FGI) equity index’s market capitalisation.

“These seven names have gone a long way to helping equity markets go higher, so if they stumble then the effects could be felt widely,” say Hewson and Coatsworth.

Nvidia shares are up 149.87% year-to-date, though the stock sold off heavily in July and into early August. The share price has recovered some ground since then but fell 3% in yesterday’s trading session ahead of the highly anticipated earnings report next week.

“From a fundamental, earnings point of view, Nvidia has demolished consensus estimates and raised guidance for each of the past five quarters, which helps to explain its stellar share price performance,” say Hewson and Coatsworth.

Nvidia said it expects revenues of $28bn for the second-quarter, which is more than double the $13.5bn it reported for the same period last year. If Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offers any steer on the third quarter, Hewson and Coatsworth say the current consensus forecast on revenue is $30.7bn, versus $18.1bn for Q3 last year.

Based on Huang’s guidance for gross margins, operating expenses and tax charges, Hewson and Coatsworth said this implies a net profit of $15bn for the second quarter, which is more than double the figure reported last year, but broadly flat on the previous quarter. They said this also suggests headline earnings per share (EPS) of $0.63 for Q2, up from $0.61 in the first quarter.

Looking ahead, they said that analysts will be keeping an eye out for comments from Huang on reported delays in the launch of Nvidia’s new Blackwell chips.

“Production of Blackwell was due to ramp up in the second half of this year, as Nvidia looks to maintain its technological lead by quickly improving upon the Hopper chipset,” Hewson and Coatsworth said.

Prudential (PRU.L) — Reports first-half results on Wednesday 28 August

Another company reporting on Wednesday is financial services firm Prudential, which has seen its shares fall by nearly a third over the past year, slumping to 12-year lows.

AJ Bell’s Hewson and Coatsworth said that the shares have been “dragged down by markets’ disappointment with how the economies of Hong Kong and China are failing to show markedly improved momentum after the conclusion of their lengthy lockdowns imposed because of Covid-19.”

They explained that Prudential is now a play on demand for financial services in Asia and Africa, following the spin-off of fund manager M&G (MNG.L) in 2019, a fundraising in Hong Kong in 2021 and its 2022 demerger from Jackson Financial (JXN).

“Prudential’s long-term strategy is to position itself for both population growth as well as increased prosperity and the rise of the middle class, as this is potentially the sweet spot for increased demand for financial products and services,” Hewson and Coatsworth said.

Hong Kong was Prudential’s most profitable market in 2022, followed by Singapore, Mainland China, Malaysia and Indonesia, with it highlighting India, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan and the Philippines as high-growth markets.

Prudential’s CEO Anil Wadhwani, who took the reins earlier last year, set out two new financial objectives, one of which was to achieve a compound growth of 15% to 20% in new business profit between 2022 and 2027.

New business profit jumped 45% to $3.1bn in 2023, but Hewson and Coatsworth note that this was flat in the first quarter of 2024 on a constant currency basis, despite the firm pointing to a headline figure of 11% growth “excluding economic impacts” on a constant currency basis.

Another metric that they said would be in focus is Prudential’s operating profit, which on an adjusted basis came in at $2.9bn in 2023, up 8% on the previous year.

Prudential paid out a dividend of 20.47 cents (16.5p) per share in 2023, with Hewson and Coatsworth saying that analysts expect a 6% increase in these distributions to the equivalent of 17.5p a share. The company announced a 2023 first interim dividend of 6.26 cents, or 5.16p, per share.

Hewson and Coatsworth said that another figure that investors will be looking at is Prudential’s annual premium equivalent, as a measure of new business written. This increased by 37% to $5.9bn in 2023 and grew by 7% on a constant currency basis in the first quarter of this year, “thanks to a tough base for comparison in Hong Kong and China and a slowdown in Vietnam"".

CrowdStrike (CRWD) – Reports second quarter results on Wednesday 28 August

CrowdStrike is set to report its second-quarter financial results on Wednesday, 28 August with the market keenly focused on the aftermath of the July IT outage that has significantly impacted the company’s valuation.

The cloud-based security company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.98 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +32.4%, according to Zachs Research. Revenues are expected to be $958.66m, up 31% from the year-ago quarter.

The cybersecurity leader has seen its market value sharply decline after its involvement in a Microsoft-related IT disruption that caused widespread chaos. The incident, attributed to “a single content update for Windows hosts”, led to severe disruptions across various sectors, including airlines, emergency services and media outlets globally, according to CrowdStrike president George Kurtz.

In the wake of the outage, businesses affected have initiated legal action against both CrowdStrike and Microsoft. Notably, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines (DAL) has filed claims, citing losses ranging from $350m to $500m after being forced to cancel more than 6,000 flights.

As investors await CrowdStrike’s earnings call, they are particularly interested in how the ongoing legal challenges will impact the company’s financial health. However, Wedbush analysts have suggested that the financial damage may be less severe than initially anticipated.

According to legal experts cited by Wedbush, CrowdStrike’s potential liabilities from Delta’s lawsuit are likely to be in the ""single-digit"" millions, thanks to favourable user contracts that limit the company’s exposure to claims for revenue losses and liability.

Despite these reassurances, there are concerns that the reputational damage from the outage could lead to a loss of future business, a risk that may weigh on CrowdStrike's long-term prospects.

Citi (C) analysts said that CrowdStrike won't come out of the incident ""unscathed"" given higher discounts, lower negotiating leverage, and litigation costs it now faces.

Foot Locker (FL) – Reports second quarter results on Wednesday 28 August

Citi has revised its outlook on Foot Locker, increasing the price target from $27 to $33, while maintaining a Neutral rating on the stock. This change comes in anticipation of Foot Locker’s second-quarter earnings report on Wednesday before the US bell.

Citi's analysis say Foot Locker may outperform consensus expectations for both sales and earnings per share in the second quarter.

Its optimism is driven by stronger-than-expected comparable store sales and gross margins, bolstered by the robust performance of several key brands in Foot Locker’s portfolio, including Adi Terrace, New Balance, Hoka, and On.

Despite underperformance from Nike (NKE), Foot Locker’s largest brand, Citi believes the retailer will show a positive inflection in comparable sales for the second quarter, recovering from last year’s promotional pressures that negatively impacted gross margins.

The retailer is expected to report a quarterly loss of $0.09 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 325%. However, revenues are projected to reach $1.88bn, marking a 0.9% increase compared to the same quarter last year, according to Zachs Research.

Foot Locker’s management is expected to reaffirm its fiscal year 2024 guidance, though third-quarter projections may come in below consensus due to anticipated weaker gross margins.

Recent analyst actions showcase a range of views on Foot Locker’s prospects. Following a disappointing first-quarter performance in 2024, Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock from Equalweight to Underweight, lowering the price target to $18 due to a more cautious outlook for 2024 (EPS, driven by expectations of a decline in both top-line growth and gross margins).

Argus also maintained a Hold rating on Foot Locker, expressing caution about near-term earnings pressure as the company navigates a strategic transformation. Conversely, Jefferies, Barclays and Telsey Advisory Group have raised their price targets to $26, $27, and $27, respectively, recognising Foot Locker’s recent performance.

2024-08-23T11:31:05+00:00,Big Tech dominance is forcing index superpowers to rethink rules,"(Bloomberg) -- The Big Tech boom is causing headaches for all-powerful index providers on Wall Street, who can send billions of benchmark-tracking dollars on the move with just a stroke of the pen.

Two of the world’s biggest – FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices – are presenting plans to undercut the weighting of the largest megacap companies in key indexes. The rare intervention comes as the US equity market becomes increasingly lopsided thanks to the growing dominance of the likes of Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc.

Players of all stripes are being forced to adapt as the ownership of the largest tech shares in many portfolios starts to push against regulatory limits. And the pressure is building for the two index overlords, whose products are tracked by a combined $35 trillion.

The proposals offer fresh ammunition for critics of the passive-investing boom, who have long pointed out such strategies are more active than they appear. Any adjustments in an index reveal the hidden human hands behind the benchmarks.

“Most investors may not realize that there is some degree of activeness even in what we consider passive strategies,” said Antti Petajisto, head of equities at Brooklyn Investment Group.

Russell’s consultation, which is about capping the weighting of the largest members of its widely followed US growth and value gauges, is open until Aug. 30, with no time frame set for implementation.

S&P’s consultation — focused on a new approach to restrain companies in a family of sector measures — ends Friday, with the changes scheduled to take effect on Sept. 23 if they are adopted.

Behind the proposals are longstanding rules for regulated investment companies that limit any single security to 25% of a portfolio and the aggregate weight of the largest holdings — those with a 5% representation or greater — to 50%. In the industry it’s often dubbed 25/5/50.

Established to safeguard investors from over-exposure to too few names, the restrictions can be punishing in the modern market where companies such as Apple and Nvidia keep getting bigger.

Last month, the top 10 constituents of the Russell 1000 Index — which are mainly tech stocks — comprised 34% of the gauge. While that’s not yet testing 25/5/50, it’s a level of concentration unseen in the benchmark’s 45-year history.

Story continues

Russell already offers a suite of capped indexes to supplement its more traditional, unconstrained measures. What’s being considered now is whether to apply weight caps to its standard style gauges, according to Catherine Yoshimoto, director of product management at FTSE Russell, an LSEG business. More than $7 trillion of assets are benchmarked to the firm’s style indexes.

“Some clients are really pushing us to consider capping the standard Russell 1000 Growth Index, for example,” she said.

A spokesperson for S&P declined to comment beyond the consultation paper and its index methodology.

Passive funds have been grabbing market share from their active rivals in the past two decades, thanks to rock-bottom costs and the perceived shortcomings of discretionary stock pickers. Still, some market participants like to point out that this index revolution is less radical than it appears.

In this view, top-down decisions are made by humans in virtually every stage of a “passive” strategy, whether it’s writing the rules of an index, deciding how to apply them, designing the fund that tracks the benchmark, or actually executing its trades. For instance, contrary to what many assume, the S&P 500 Index — the main benchmark for the world’s largest stock market — does not simply contain America’s 500 biggest companies. Its members are selected by a group of anonymous index experts.

The proposed changes by S&P and Russell underscore the kinds of interventions that take place — and the differences between firms that can arise as a result.

When it comes to adhering to the 25/5/50 limits, index managers use differing mechanisms to cap a company’s weight, as well as different triggers for when that process kicks in (although they all typically opt for a level slightly below 25/5/50 to provide a buffer.)

For example, in its proposal, Russell presents a capping threshold at 20/4.5/48. That’s different from the Nasdaq 100, whose methodology calls for 24/4.5/48, and S&P, whose cutoff is 24/4.8/50. The disparity likely reflects diverse approaches to determine the best way to reduce the probability of a breach occurring on a regular basis, according to Yoshimoto at Russell.

Meanwhile to cap company weights, indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 tend to trim top holdings proportionally. But when a number of stocks breach the limit in S&P’s sector gauges, the smallest is trimmed first, suppressing its weight in the gauge — and leaving investors under-exposed.

That’s what happened in funds like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) in the first half of this year, when Nvidia was surging higher. The rules meant XLK under-owned the stock, so it trailed an uncapped tech benchmark by 10 percentage points in the period — the worst underperformance on record.

Then, when Nvidia eclipsed Apple in June, it sparked a rebalance in which XLK bought an estimated $11 billion shares of the chipmaker at the expense of the iPhone manufacturer. Now that their positions are flipped again, XLK is at risk of another round of big shuffling. Should the current rankings hold until the next quarterly rebalance due September, Nvidia’s weight in the fund may have to drop to 4.5% from 21% as Apple’s spikes to 22% from 4.8%, based on the existing methodology.

S&P’s proposed revision is aimed at reducing such frequent high turnovers, according to Edward Yoon, an index specialist at Macquarie Capital. Rather than targeting the smallest of the group that violates the diversification rule, the index owner proffers curbing them all in proportion to their market values.

To Josh Kutin, head of asset allocation, North America at Columbia Threadneedle Investments, whatever emerges from the consultations is surely no bad thing as it will help investors tackle the challenge of the increasingly concentrated market.

“Asset allocators are obsessed with getting diversification so the more concentrated our portfolios are in any sense, the more uncomfortable we get,” he said. “I’m in favor of changes to reduce the reliance on market cap in index construction, even if that’s a human decision rather than a market mechanism.”

2024-08-23T09:06:00+00:00,62% of Warren Buffett's $314 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 4 Unstoppable Stocks,"On Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett is truly in a class of his own. Without using fancy software or trading algorithms, the Oracle of Omaha has, over nearly six decades, nearly doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends paid, of the benchmark S&P 500. On an aggregate return basis, we're talking about Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A) increasing in value by roughly 5,387,100% under Buffett's watch.

When you deliver outsized returns on Wall Street, you tend to draw a crowd. Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting regularly lures in the neighborhood of 40,000 investors eager to hear Buffett speak about the U.S. economy, the stocks Berkshire holds, and his investment philosophy. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.

But thanks to quarterly filed Form 13Fs, we don't have to wait a full year to get the skinny on what Warren Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying and selling.

Although Berkshire Hathaway closed out the June quarter with 45 stocks and two exchange-traded funds in its approximately $314 billion investment portfolio, one of the key traits that's allowed Buffett and his team to vastly outperform the S&P 500 for so long is concentration. In other words, Buffett and his team strongly believe in putting extra capital to work in their best ideas.

As of the closing bell on Aug. 16, 62% ($193.3 billion) of the $314 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in just four unstoppable stocks.

Apple: $90.42 billion (28.8% of invested assets)

As has been the case for many years, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains Berkshire's top holding.

However, the Oracle of Omaha and his team have dumped a significant percentage of their company's stake in Apple over the prior three quarters. This position once briefly accounted for up to 50% of Berkshire's invested assets.

Although Buffett opined during his company's latest annual shareholder meeting that he believes Apple is a great company, he also hinted that corporate tax rates are liable to climb in the coming years. With Berkshire Hathaway sitting on a mountain of unrealized gains from its Apple stake, Buffett presumed that investors would eventually come to appreciate he and his team locking in gains and paying a historically low tax rate.

Warren Buffett is also an unabashed fan of Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Adding the $26.5 billion spent on share buybacks during the company's fiscal third quarter (ended June 29, 2024), Apple has put a whopping $700 billion to work repurchasing its stock since the start of 2013. Buybacks can incrementally increase the ownership stakes of investors, as well as provide a lift to earnings per share.

Story continues

But the cautionary tale with Apple is that its growth engine has mostly stalled. While revenue tied to its subscription ecosystem have steadily grown, sales for physical devices, including iPhone, have been less than impressive.

American Express: $38.2 billion (12.2% of invested assets)

The second longest-tenured stock in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, credit-services goliath American Express(NYSE: AXP), is currently Buffett's second-largest holding. AmEx, as American Express is commonly known, has been a continuous holding since 1991 and is considered by Buffett to be one of his company's eight ""indefinite"" holdings.

Financials are Buffett's favorite sector to put his company's money to work in, and the reason why is simple: they're cyclical.

The Oracle of Omaha and his top aides are fully aware that economic contractions and recessions are normal and inevitable. Rather than foolishly (small 'f') trying to guess when these downturns will occur, Berkshire's brightest minds are playing a numbers game that's very much in their favor. Since recessions are short-lived -- nine out of 12 recessions since the end of World War II resolved in less than 12 months -- and most periods of expansion last multiple years, it pays to buy and hold high-quality businesses that grow in lockstep with the U.S. economy.

What makes AmEx special is its ability to benefit from both sides of the transaction aisle. It's currently the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., which allows it to collect fees from merchants.

But it's also a lender to consumers and businesses via its various credit cards. This helps facilitate the collection of annual fees and interest income. Being able to double dip during lengthy periods of economic expansion and play from both sides of the retail counter has been its not-so-subtle secret to success. Image source: Getty Images.

Bank of America: $37.08 billion (11.8% of invested assets)

The third-largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's 45-stock, $314 billion portfolio overseen by Buffett is money-center giant Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). Following the sale of more than $3.8 billion worth of BofA shares by Berkshire's investment team between July 17 and Aug. 1, Bank of America has fallen behind AmEx in the pecking order.

Buffett's love for bank stocks also revolves around their cyclical nature. During recessions, banks usually contend with higher loan losses and credit delinquencies. By comparison, their loan portfolios typically expand during substantially longer periods of economic growth.

What's made Bank of America such an attractive investment over the last two years is its sensitivity to changes in interest rates.

Beginning in March 2022, the Federal Reserve kicked off its steepest rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s. No money-center bank has benefited more, in terms of added net interest income, than BofA. Conversely, an expected rate-easing cycle has the potential to adversely affect Bank of America's net interest income more than its peers. This may be why Buffett has his crew have been sellers of late.

Furthermore, Bank of America's management team hasn't been shy about investing in digitization. As of the midpoint of 2024, 77% of its consumer households were banking digitally and 53% of all consumer loans were completed online or via mobile app. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper for banks than in-person interactions, which should eventually lead to improved operating efficiency for BofA.

Coca-Cola: $27.67 billion (8.8% of invested assets)

The fourth top holding in Buffett's $314 billion portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway that, along with Apple, American Express, and Bank of America, collectively accounts for 62% of invested assets is beverage kingpin Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO). Coca-Cola is Buffett's longest continuously held investment at 36 years (since 1988).

The beautiful thing about consumer staples stocks is they're a necessity no matter what's going on with the U.S./global economy or the stock market. As a provider of brand-name beverages, demand for the company's products tends to be highly predictable year after year.

It also doesn't hurt that Coca-Cola is one of the most recognized brands in the world. Its marketing team leans on digital media channels and artificial intelligence (AI) to reach younger audiences, while relying on well-known brand ambassadors and over a century of history to connect with its mature consumers.

To add to this point, Kantar's annual ""Brand Footprint"" study found that Coke's products have been the most-chosen from retail shelves for 12 consecutive years. Having strong branding usually translates into exceptional pricing power.

The cherry on top for Coca-Cola is that it's a geographically diverse company. With the exception of Cuba, North Korea, and Russia, it has operations ongoing in every country. This ensures consistent operating cash flow from developed markets, as well as the ability to move the organic growth needle in emerging markets.

Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:

The Better Semiconductor Stock to Buy Now: TSM or INTC

The semiconductor industry has witnessed stupendous growth over the past four decades, with chips becoming an integral part of electronic devices like computers and smartphones, to name a few. An increase in acceptance of emerging technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to fuel demand for semiconductors.

Manufacturing, healthcare, and retail sectors have already integrated digital technologies that require robust semiconductor solutions. Thus, the global semiconductor industry is likely to witness a CAGR of 14.9% from 2024 to 2032, hitting $2062.59 billion by 2032, per Fortune Business Insights.

However, despite the positive trend, picking the top semiconductor stocks is challenging since their sales fluctuate incessantly. So, here is one chip stock to buy right away — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. — and one industry bigwig to shun — Intel Corp.

2 Reasons to Be Bullish on TSM

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing expects healthy demand for its chips as more companies begin to implement AI features in smartphones. Apple Inc.’s initiative to launch the iPhone 16 this fall should boost demand for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s chips. The new “Apple Intelligence” system has already benefited Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Apple is one of the biggest clients of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and accounts for around one-fourth of TSM’s revenues.

Demand for AI applications like Alphabet Inc.’s Gemini and Open AI’s ChatGPT has increased noticeably. But such applications require huge data, kept in data centers, which rely on graphic processing units (GPUs) that NVIDIA Corporation manufactures. And without TSM’s manufacturing prowess, the GPUs can’t be operative. So, in a way, the surging demand for AI applications would continue to boost Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s sales over the next several years and help its shares soar.

No doubt, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s earnings outlook for the current year remains promising, with the $6.45 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share up 11.4% from a year ago.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s shares have already outperformed the iShares Semiconductor ETF this year (+64.6% vs. +22.6%).

2 Reasons to be Bearish on INTC

Intel, regrettably, is losing its competitive edge over its rival Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Intel is in a fix after failing to make much progress in its foundry business. AMD has progressed significantly in producing high-performance processing machinery. Intel’s failure to take advantage of the ever-growing AI applications industry is alarming against the strong growth posted by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, which is currently the industry standard.

On the other hand, Arm Holdings plc is disrupting Intel’s server, storage, and networking space. ARM’s designs in the micro server segment have witnessed espousal by quite a lot of Intel’s competitors. As a result, Intel’s earnings outlook for the current year remains bleak, with the $0.38 Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share down a massive 77.5% from a year ago.

Intel’s shares have underperformed SOXX year to date, down 57.4%. Notably, both Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Intel are listed in SOXX.

TSM Fundamentals – Very Strong

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, by the way, has generated profits more competently than Intel. This is because TSM has a return on equity (ROE) of 25.5%, while Intel’s is around 4.4%. As a thumb rule, any reading above 20% is primarily considered very strong.

Meanwhile, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a stable business model. Its dividend payout ratio sits at 31% of earnings, a low payout that indicates the company is reinvesting the bulk of its earnings in research and development, a must for growth. Whereas, Intel’s dividend payout ratio is 109% of earnings, which is unsustainable.

TSM Less Pricey Than INTC

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s shares are less expensive than Intel’s, which has given the integrated circuit foundry an edge over the world’s largest semiconductor company. After all, buying INTC’s shares will burn a larger hole in your wallet than the TSM stock.

This is because, per the Price/Earnings ratio, TSM stock presently trades at 26.5X forward earnings. However, INTC’s forward earnings multiple is 56.6X.

TSM to Buy Hand Over Fist

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, rightfully, is a better buy than Intel as it is well-positioned to make the most of the growth in AI, can generate profit consistently, and has a lower valuation.

Prominent brokers have also increased the average short-term price target of TSM by almost 19% from the company’s last closing price of $172.04. The analysts’ highest price target is at $250.

2024-08-23T07:00:00+00:00,"The Cheapest Trillion-Dollar Stock: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, or Meta?","Six U.S. companies are valued at $1 trillion or more, and they all operate in the technology sector:

Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): $3.44 trillion Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT): $3.16 trillion Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): $3.14 trillion Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): $2.07 trillion Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN): $1.87 trillion Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): $1.33 trillion

All of these companies are profitable, so they can be valued with the widely used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. It's calculated by dividing the share price of a given company by its earnings per share. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 30.9, which is a good reference point: NVDA PE Ratio Chart

Nvidia is the most expensive trillion-dollar stock today on a P/E basis. However, the company is growing so quickly it has a forward P/E ratio of just 33.1 based on next year's earnings forecast. In other words, its valuation is much more reasonable if investors are willing to hold it for a couple of years.

The cheapest stock of the group is Alphabet. A judge recently ruled that Google Search is a monopoly, and the U.S. Department of Justice wants to break up the company to resolve that issue. It could take years -- if it happens at all -- but combined with growing competition from artificial intelligence chatbots, which are threatening the dominance of Google Search, investors are treading cautiously with respect to Alphabet's valuation.

Finally, Amazon deserves a mention. It's on track to generate $635 billion in revenue this year, which is more than any of its peers, and it trades at the cheapest price-to-sales ratio (which divides a company's market capitalization by its revenue). Plus, its earnings are forecast to grow 63% this year and 23% in 2025, so its elevated P/E ratio might actually be justified.

In summary, a P/E ratio alone isn't always the best indicator of value. Investors could easily make the case that despite trading at triple the P/E ratio, Nvidia stock is a better buy than Alphabet because of its rapid growth (and Alphabet's regulatory headwinds).
