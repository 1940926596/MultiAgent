The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Visa Inc. (V) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>

Apple’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+33.6% vs. +33.0%). The company is benefiting from strong demand for the iPhone. Apple expects the iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis in first-quarter fiscal 2024.

Revenues for Mac are expected to significantly accelerate compared with the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023’s reported figure. It expects the year-over-year revenue growth for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches.

For the Services segment, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. It is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ aids subscriber growth.

(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)

Shares of Visa have outperformed the Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry over the past year (+19.8% vs. +15.6%). The company’s stock prices are driven by strategic acquisitions and alliances fostering long-term growth.

Fueled by increased payments and sustained investments in technology, it is witnessing bottomline growth. The ongoing shift to digital payments is advantageous for Visa, with strong domestic volumes supporting overall performance. A robust cash position enables the company to enhance shareholder value.

However, elevated operating expenses pose margin challenges. Increased client incentives may impact the top line. Additionally, it is witnessing a declining cash volume from the Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.

(You can read the full research report on Visa here >>>)

Shares of Novo Nordisk have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+58.5% vs. +22.8%). The company has one of the broadest diabetes portfolios in the industry. Ozempic and Rybelsus have been performing well in the diabetes market.

Obesity drug Wegovy has been enjoying increasing demand. Label expansions of diabetes and obesity care drugs in cardiovascular and other indications will likely boost sales. Novo Nordisk raised its 2023 view due to higher demand for Ozempic and Wegovy.

Its diversifying efforts to develop new treatments are encouraging. To tackle the supply constraints of Wegovy in international markets, Novo recently announced initiating a €2.1 billion project to expand its current manufacturing facility in Chartres, France. Despite intense rivalry in the obesity care market, Novo Nordisk has been maintaining its market share.

2024-01-30T21:23:18+00:00,3 Must-Watch Stocks Just as Unstoppable as Nvidia,"Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains one of the hottest stocks in the market right now, with shares eeking out yet another 2.35% gain on Monday’s session. After Nvidia stock’s January jump, shares are flirting with 30% in year-to-date gains. That’s an impressive annual return, let alone one posted in under a month. As to when (or if) shares of the chip giant are bound to reverse course remains the top question on the minds of shareholders and those enjoying the Nvidia show from the sidelines.

Some way or another, NVDA stock has found a way to keep pulling rabbits out of hats, something that could easily continue through 2024. Either way, Nvidia stock remains a dangerous stock to bet against amid its AI tailwind.

Though momentum investors still have lots to love about Nvidia and its latest melt-up, I’d argue it’s worth checking in on other stocks that have already gained traction in recent weeks. Indeed, many such plays may be overheated after their respective rallies. However, each is worth keeping tabs on as we march into earnings season. Let’s check in briefly with three momentum stocks as strong as Nvidia that I’d stash in the “must-watch” category.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Warren Buffett’s low-tech conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B, BRK-A) has been steadily (and pretty quietly) making new highs in recent sessions. Just last week, the stock hit $385 and change after enjoying a remarkable seven-day win streak. Thanks, in part, to its huge investment in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Japanese companies and various other firms, Berkshire Hathaway is now a stock that has something for value and momentum investors to love.

Though Berkshire hasn’t been ultra active of late, it has made intriguing moves, including buying more shares of Liberty SiriusXM Group (NASDAQ:LSXMA). With shares of LSXMA currently trading at just 11.6 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), it’s not hard to imagine why Buffett’s firm has picked up a few more shares. Indeed, the stock looks cheap in a market that may be getting a tad overheated.

Story continues

As Berkshire continues playing the long-term game, it remains one of the more value-conscious picks to make the new all-time high list. And it’s worth tuning into if you’re off-put by some of the tech scene right now.

T-Mobile US (TMUS) TMUS stock

Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com

T-MobileUS (NASDAQ:TMUS) stock also recently hit new heights after clocking in a handful of respectable quarters last year. More recently, the firm missed earnings estimates for its fourth quarter but topped on sales. Despite the initial adverse reaction, investors now seem more forgiving, given the company’s high hopes for new customer additions in 2024.

Undoubtedly, the red-hot wireless play has been flying above and beyond its peers in the telecom industry. Led higher by an impressive network (it’s one to beat) and competitive prices, T-Mobile stands out as one of the market gainers that doesn’t seem content just sitting around.

T-Mobile stock’s impressive performance (shares up 134% in the last five years) versus the peer group suggests the wireless scene is transforming into a winner-takes-most sort of environment. And as our high-speed data consumption grows, it’s hard not to want to jump on the T-Mobile bandwagon as it looks to enter the industry’s newest chapter of growth.

At writing, shares trade at 23.4 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s not a hefty multiple to pay for an industry leader with a distinct edge and a management team that knows how to get things done.

For 2024, analysts expect TMUS stock to continue doing what it does best: make higher highs.

Costco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession Pick

Source: Shutterstock

Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is another low-tech stock having a breakout moment, of sorts. With shares flirting with $700 per share — one more big up day will do it — COST may very well be the next momentum stock to hog the headlines should Nvidia stock’s rally begin to falter. Either way, Costco’s management seems well-equipped to make the most of the traffic surge in its stores.

Many Costco shoppers have a bulk appetite for the Kirkland Signature brand (Costco’s high-quality private label) these days, and it is not a mystery as to why. Costco does private labels far better than any other large-scale retailer, in my opinion. With Kirkland, Costco shows us that consumers don’t need to compromise on quality to save money amid hard times.

As Costco expands Kirkland (perhaps they should sell Kirkland Signature gold bars next?), Costco stands out as a momentum stock that can (and likely will) grow into its seemingly expensive trailing P/E — currently 46.73.

Even if not, keeping a close watch on some major stocks ahead of their earnings date can help give you a better idea of how the overall market landscape is developing – for good or for bad.

The S&P 500 is marking all-time highs, and of the companies in the index that reported thus far, nearly 70% posted a positive EPS surprise. Great news, right?

Despite individual company strengths (or analysts’ misaligned expectations), the index’s collective earnings marked a 1.4% year-over-year (YoY) decline – not a particularly bullish indicator, considering how different the sentiment was this time last year. Likewise, though many companies have yet to report, a sizeable percentage are offering negative EPS guidance as they face greater uncertainty than current index pricing indicates.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

What all this means is that, increasingly, we can’t rely on a “stocks go up” theory of earnings when evaluating short-term trades. At the same time, though, some overbought individual stocks seem to be a house of cards propping up a shaky market – making bets on them a risky proposition.

Here are a handful of top stocks to watch before earnings – alongside whether or not they’re worth a buy at this stage in the game.

Buy: Palantir (PLTR)

Earnings Date: Monday, February 5th (After Hours) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.

Source: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com

Among the many well-known stocks reporting in February, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) is the easiest to call a Buy today. After four consecutive profitable quarters, the AI and data analytics software firm is well on its way to marking its fifth. Right now, analysts are projecting earnings roughly aligned with last quarter’s, which hit a $0.07 EPS. If the thesis bears out, that represents a 100% jump on a YoY basis, which supports the collective consensus that the company will grow 85% annually over the next five years.

Story continues

A major tailwind for Palantir is that it’s now eligible for S&P 500 inclusion after four consecutive profitable periods. Palantir is already larger, by market cap, than 3/5 of the current index holdings. At the same time, applied AI will likely continue propelling Palantir forward. In many cases, the AI bubble is borderline bursting – “normal” companies, i.e., those without a clear AI use case, failed to demonstrate how adopting current AI tech benefited their bottom line. That’s despite the constant usage of AI-adjacent buzzwords in marketing materials and earnings calls.

But Palantir is one of the few companies with a clear, demonstrable, and viable AI platform that existed well before the current craze. Palantir’s wide-ranging AI offerings help across unique use cases, including combat targeting, intelligence, corporate data insight, public health forecasting, and more. As investors lose enthusiasm for AI labeling stamped across every company’s face, Palantir stands out as one of the few that will weather the imminent drawdown.

Sell before Earnings: Chipotle (CMG)

Earnings Date: Tuesday, February 6th (After Hours) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle

Source: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com

Chipotle (NYSE:CMG) consumer sentiment is slowly turning against Chipotle, as a cursory social media search sees scores of dissatisfied customers complaining about slow and incorrect orders, poor ingredient quality, and a general feeling that the once-hot burrito company isn’t what it used to be. This is likely due, in no small part, to increased emphasis on cost-cutting at the expense of what made Chipotle the hot stock it is today. Of course, quantifying social sentiment of this type is difficult, but a look at CMG’s fundamentals reinforces a Sell rating.

From the outset, CMG’s basic ratios skew far too high for comfort, trading at 55x earnings and 22x book value. Likewise, it trades at 1.75x earnings growth – all of which indicates gross overvaluation in light of its relatively precarious position as a pricy fast food alternative, social sentiment aside. The company’s YoY EPS growth is strong, to be sure – nearly 40% in last year’s report, but the stat is trending downward to align itself more closely with CMG’s 10-year growth average of just 13.86%.

Ultimately, Chipotle is a restaurant mainstay, and the stock isn’t going anywhere soon. But its current per-share price is far too overblown to be worth investing in now, and if you’re a shareholder, I’d be concerned that just a hint of bad news could send shares tumbling faster than it takes to order a burrito bowl.

Buy: McDonald’s (MCD)

Earnings Date: Monday, February 5th (Pre-Market) Man holds out a McDonald's bag with the golden arches logo on it at a drive-thru window.

On the fast food flip side, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) remains a strong Buy as it prepares to be one of the first stocks reporting earnings in February. Across the board, top analysts are bullish on McDonald’s. One Wedbush analyst said that it’s “hard to see McDonald’s not ‘winning’ in any consumer environment.” At the same time, a Jefferies rating expert took to CNBC to call McDonald’s a top pick in the restaurant industry as the “best defensive and offensive play in restaurants,” with “resiliency in an uncertain or weak macro [economic climate].

But the widely enthusiastic endorsement isn’t backed up by MCD’s per-share pricing; the stock climbed just under 8% over the preceding 12 months and lost about 2% since January 1st. A tough 2022 didn’t help the cause, as McDonald’s posted an annual revenue and income decrease alongside a slim margin improvement. But, on the heels of right-sizing operations and improved economic outlook, analysts expect the company to post a 7% EPS jump and 9% revenue growth in its upcoming earnings.

Sell before Earnings: PayPal (PYPL)

Earnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (After Hours) PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) icon displayed on smartphone with keyboard background. is an American multinational financial technology company operating an online payment

Source: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com

Despite the CEO’s plans to “shock the world,” PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) seems destined to disappoint this earnings season. In a bizarre attempt to ape Steve Jobs’ vibe, the “next big thing” in payment processing turned out to be new checkout procedures that “[replace] cumbersome password inputs with biometric alternatives like face or fingerprint recognition.” That’s right – PayPal’s revolutionary news is that it finally caught up to a range of existing applications that offer exactly that.

Unsurprisingly, shares dipped slightly after the underwhelming Innovation Day proceedings, though the stock is up slightly since the month began. But it may not stay solid for long, as PayPal’s house of cards could quickly crack on just a hint of poor outcomes. PayPal’s market share domination sets it apart from the competition, to be fair. But competition is increasing, and though PayPal tends to be a top pick for computer-based payment processing, it lags significantly on mobile – where the bulk of tomorrow’s digital shoppers buy things today (see the next paragraph for specifics!).

Buy: Apple (AAPL)

Source: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com

Though I alluded to the company in the previous paragraph, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent pivots point to long-term strength that makes the stock a buy despite its fairly high per-share pricing. Specifically, Apple’s emphasis on services – like Apple Pay and its podcasting platform – represents a cheap, high-margin flywheel that’s already dominating some specific consumer sectors.

The top-line stats for Apple Pay alone are, frankly, astonishing. They reinforce the bull thesis for Apple while cementing PayPal’s increasing irrelevance to tomorrow’s shopping ecosystem. Apple Pay has already captured 92% of the digital wallet marketplace, processing 12.6% of all online consumer payments in 2023, with 48% of customers using the digital wallet for in-person transactions. Those stats mark a new age for Apple while signaling a death knell for PayPal’s past dominance.

From a hardware perspective, Apple is also focusing on creating greater verticals throughout its supply chain to protect against the kind of geopolitical shock we see with increased regularity. The company’s renewed in-house component production efforts will help it cut costs while ensuring quality and, of course, protect against supply chain shocks moving forward.

Sell before Earnings: Alibaba Group (BABA)

Saying that Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) is a Sell is a tough call. On one hand, the company’s per-share pricing is closer than ever to its IPO debut cost and worth just a third of its 2020 high. And, unlike many other ZIRP-era high flyers, BABA isn’t a flash in the pan.

Unfortunately, pure economic risk in China puts too much pressure on this stock to make it worth buying before earnings. And, while that topic is a bit too complex to look at, other factors are pressuring BABA stock that make it worth selling before earnings.

Despite its size, there’s little real moat involved in BABA’s operational model. That’s clear as a primary competitor, Piunduoduo (NASDAQ:PDD) beat BABA as the top eCommerce stock in China. Both companies’ core value proposition is rock-bottom pricing. But, while BABA focused on overseas manufacturing, Piunduoduo’s China-specific emphasis lets it snag market share away. At the same time, those supply chain shocks mentioned in the last paragraph pressure BABA’s overseas shipments, and companies are increasingly looking elsewhere, like Latin America, for scaled production.

Sell: Affirm Holdings (AFRM)

I covered the Sell thesis behind Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) last week, but it’s worth revisiting before the company posts earnings. This is also a fairly contrarian position, as the stock surged more than 185% over the past year. But I think this bubble is about to burst soon, if not after this upcoming earnings report.

You probably recognize that Affirm’s core business revolves around its buy now, pay later (BNPL) model. This model essentially provides consumers with short-term micro-loans at the point of sale. However, for better or worse, the BNPL solutions tend to attract consumers with less-than-stellar credit. With credit card delinquency rates on the rise, it seems inevitable that Affirm will face a surge in unpaid BNPL loans.

Affirm’s latest financial statements reveal a significant increase in its allowance for credit losses (expected delinquency write-offs), which surged by over 10% year-over-year. This uptick occurred even before the holiday sales season when tons of consumers undoubtedly maxed out their credit cards and relied heavily on Affirm’s BNPL services. Given the current consumer and macroeconomic trends, the short-term outlook for Affirm appears bleak, positioning it as one of the top stocks to sell before earnings.

Apple is set to announce its first quarter earnings results after the bell on Thursday.

According to Kuo, who has accurately predicted Apple's moves in the past, a drop in iPhone sales in China coupled with the emergence of generative AI-powered and foldable smartphones will put pressure on iPhone sales throughout the year.

""Apple’s weekly shipments in China have declined by 30%–40% [year over year] in recent weeks, and this downward trend is expected to continue,"" Kuo wrote in a post on Medium. Customers are experiencing the newly launched iPhone 15 at Apple's flagship store in Shanghai, China, on Sept. 24, 2023. (Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)

""The main reason for the decline is the return of Huawei and the fact that foldable phones have gradually become the first choice for high-end users in the Chinese market.""

Barclays, Piper Sandler, and Redburn Atlantic downgraded Apple’s stock in early January on concerns over iPhone sales in China. Bank of America, however, upgraded Apple's stock, citing its Vision Pro headset and generative AI as future growth catalysts.

The downward trend has also cost Apple its spot as the richest publicly traded company by market capitalization. The company is now valued at $2.9 trillion, lower than the new top dog Microsoft, which had a market cap of $3.05 trillion as of Tuesday afternoon.

Apple is in the midst of some of its biggest changes yet, as the company prepares to make significant revisions to its App Store policies in Europe to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act. The iPhone maker says it will begin to open up European consumers' devices to third-party app stores and allow game streaming services like Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming on devices.

But critics including Epic CEO Tim Sweeney and Spotify CEO Daniel Ek say the changes don't go far enough in satisfying their respective antitrust concerns.

The Department of Justice is also reportedly considering whether it should file an antitrust lawsuit against Apple related to its App Store practices, according to Bloomberg.

All of this comes as Apple prepares to launch the Vision Pro. An AR/VR headset that Apple refers to as a spatial computer, the Vision Pro is the company's first new product category since it debuted the Apple Watch nearly a decade ago.

The Vision Pro goes on sale Feb. 2.

Apple, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), boasts a stellar track record of exceeding earnings estimates. As AAPL stock hovers near all-time highs, is the iPhone maker a buy heading into earnings?

Analysts are expecting AAPL to deliver quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share, which would reflect growth of 11.17% relative to the same quarter in the prior year. Revenues of $117.6 billion would mark a 0.4% improvement versus the year-ago period. Apple has beaten earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, sporting a 3.47% average earnings surprise over that timeframe.

Apple’s business contains a Services portfolio that has steadily grown over time, including popular services like Apple Pay and AppleCare that have become a major cash cow. The company also recently launched the mixed reality Vision Pro headset.

Our proprietary Zacks Earnings ESP is predicting another earnings beat for the upcoming announcement.

The tech giant lowered its 2024 iPhone shipments of key semiconductor components to about 200 million units, the analyst wrote in a report, citing his latest supply chain survey. That suggests shipments of the iPhone 15 and upcoming iPhone 16 will decline by 10% to 15%, he said.

China is a particular area of concern. Apple’s weekly shipments in the country have declined by 30% to 40% in recent weeks compared with the year-earlier period, and Kuo expects this trend to continue. Apple declined to comment.

Apple shares fell as low as $187.87 in New York, marking the biggest intraday drop in two weeks. The stock was little changed in 2024 heading into Tuesday.

The company reports results for its holiday quarter on Thursday, and investors are looking for signs that demand is holding up — especially for the iPhone, Apple’s biggest moneymaker. Though the iPhone faces headwinds in China, where the government has imposed some bans of foreign technology in the workplace, the device has still been gaining market share.

The iPhone was the top-selling smartphone in the country for the first time last year, according to market tracker IDC. Apple’s overall revenue is expected to up just 1% in the fiscal first quarter, which ran through December.

2024-01-30T15:25:02+00:00,'Suits' was the most viewed title in 2023 amid content licensing resurgence,"""Suits"" was the most-streamed title of 2023 — a sign that licensed content is here to stay.

According to third-party rating service Nielsen, the USA Network series was viewed for nearly 58 billion minutes last year after it spent 12 consecutive weeks at the top of Nielsen's viewership charts.

Netflix (NFLX) acquired the drama in July. It's also available to stream on Comcast's Peacock (CMCSA).

The report added that ""Suits,"" which originally aired from 2011 to 2019, surpassed ""The Office"" to become the most-streamed title ever. ""The Office"" generated 57.1 billion viewing minutes in 2020.

Other top licensed shows included ""Bluey,"" ""NCIS,"" ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""Cocomelon,"" and ""The Big Bang Theory."" Apple TV+'s ""Ted Lasso"" (AAPL) was the top original series after racking up nearly 17 billion hours viewed.

The resurgence of licensed content seems to have brought the streaming wars full circle after companies spent billions to create original IP in a bid to edge out competitors and attract subscribers.

As content budgets shrink across the board, licensed content can also keep viewers engaged between new seasons of original series.

Although Netflix has certainly led that charge — the company recently revealed 45% of all viewing on Netflix stemmed from licensed titles from January to June 2023 — it's actively shut down licensing out its own content.

""What's interesting is a show like 'Suits,' which has been played on USA for a long time, has been available on Peacock and had been available on Amazon for a couple of years before it hit Netflix, and yet we were able to unlock this enormous, enormous global audience for it,"" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a call with reporters late last year.

""That's the combination of our large subscriber base and our recommendation system that knew to put 'Suits' in front of people who were going love it the most,"" he continued. ""I do not think that that necessarily would happen in reverse. I do think that we can add tremendous value when we license content. I'm not positive that that's reciprocal.""

Sarandos reiterated that thinking during the company's earnings call last week, saying the streamer is ""open for business"" when it comes to licensing content from competitors.

""I am thrilled that the studios are more open to licensing again,"" he said. The 'Suits' effect (Source: Getty Images)

Disney (DIS) has been one competitor embracing the change.

ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy"" has been highly successful on Netflix while Disney acquired the international broadcasting rights to ""Bluey,"" the number two most-viewed acquired title, from BBC Studios in 2019.

Disney CEO Bob Iger confirmed more plans are on the way, particular when it comes to its partnership with Netflix.

""We’ve actually been licensing content to Netflix, and are going to continue too,"" he told investors during the company's latest earnings call. ""We're actually in discussion with them now about some opportunities, but I wouldn’t expect that we will license our core brands to them.""

Similar to Netflix's refusal to license out its original series, Iger said Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars and all likely off limits as they offer ""real competitive advantages"" and are ""differentiators"" for the company.

""[Those brands] are all doing very, very well on our platform. And I don’t see why, just to basically to chase bucks, we should [license them out] when they are really really important building blocks to the current and future of our streaming business.""

But analysts have described that thinking as a double edged sword, citing high debt loads and streaming profitability challenges.

In a new stock downgrade for Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday, Wells Fargo analyst Steve Cahall explained future content strategies for legacy players pose a risk as companies weigh licensing content versus maintaining streaming exclusives.

""One way to accelerate EBITDA and free cash flow would be to let marquee titles like 'The Sopranos,' 'Game of Thrones' or 'Friends' go to deep-pocketed streamers instead of Max — likely billions of untapped revenue potential,"" Cahall said in regards to WBD. ""But, this would come at the expense of Max engagement.""

As legacy giants weigh that choice, Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich described content licensing as a ""back to the future"" trend for the industry at large.

""This should improve content spending return on investments and accelerate revenue and profitability growth going forward,"" she said in a note published earlier this month.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently made news as the stock’s market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Such a high valuation raises the question of whether Microsoft can rise further.

It can.

Investors will be unsurprised to hear the reason: Artificial intelligence. Hear me out, though. Microsoft continues to have a lot of opportunities related to AI. The primary opportunity is that of monetization.

It’s fair to argue that the difference between Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft, as it relates to AI and valuation, is monetization. Microsoft’s current P/E ratio is just below 40 times. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is above 81 times.

Nvidia commands a higher premium due to the monetization of AI. Thus, the more Microsoft can monetize AI, the higher its shares can rise. Of course, Microsoft has done so with its monetization of CoPilot. However, that hasn’t been nearly as successful as Nvidia’s monetization through chip sales, which remain in high demand for AI applications.

It’s an opportunity for Microsoft, arguably making it a buy at the moment despite recently surpassing a $3 trillion valuation.

It’s a bad idea to bet against McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) stock right now. The Golden Arches are operating very well at the moment and are also seeking real, substantial growth.

Story continues

Investors considering McDonald’s a boring, slow-growth firm should think again. In December, the company announced that It plans to increase its footprint to 50,000 restaurants by 2027. That will be its fastest period of growth in history.

Meanwhile, it’s also evident that McDonald’s is attempting to win back market share from competitors—namely, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). The company continues to test its CosMc’s restaurant concept. Long wait times suggest that the restaurant concept has the potential to rest market share from Starbucks with its expansive drinks menu.

All of that positive news follows a Q3 earnings report, which showed an 11% increase in global system-wide sales. It is little wonder that some analysts expect 2024 will be very strong for McDonald’s, which has caused them to up their ratings.

Salesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs

There is little reason to believe that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) stock should rise soon. Salesforce is in something of a dead zone despite its strong performance of late.

In the third quarter, Salesforce provided better-than-expected results, including revenues that increased by 11% to $8.7 billion. The better-than-expected performance provided the company the confidence to raise guidance for multiple metrics. That’s all on top of a year that saw Salesforce shares amongst the best performers on the Dow Jones Index.

The problem is Salesforce’s revenues are expected to grow by 10% in Q4. That’s not a strong enough catalyst to propel CRM shares higher. Instead, investors should look forward to rate cuts expected to begin in June per most consensus opinions.

Lower lending rates should Galvanize greater investment in customer relationship management overall. Salesforce continues to heavily tout its AI investment in that regard. Furthermore, it’s also the dominant force in the space. However, investors are going to have to wait a few months for that catalyst to kick in.

As long as consumers are willing to absorb higher prices, there’s no reason to bet against Procter & Gamble’s (NYSE:PG) stock.

That’s the message that the market sent upon P&G’s Jan. 23 earnings release. Sales grew by a modest 3% during the most recent quarter, but that didn’t matter despite being a slight miss. What did matter is that Procter & Gamble continues to be able to pass higher prices on to consumers, leading to improved net income.

P&G now expects that net income growth will range between 8 and 9%. It had expected the range to be between 6% and 9% prior. Consumers continue to absorb price increases for their favorite fast-moving goods brands.

That was the primary takeaway of the stock market on Jan. 23. Shares jumped from $147 to $155 on the earnings release and the news contained therein. Procter & Gamble will continue to rise because consumers remain undeterred.

Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards

Resilient consumers are also the primary positive factor for Visa (NYSE:V). Its stock is rising after releasing earnings that showed better than anticipated results. The reason: strong consumer credit spending.

2023 was the year of strong consumerism fueled by credit spending. 2024 is shaping up to be no different. Visa saw its revenues increase by 9% in the first quarter on especially strong cross-border payment volume. American consumers continue to travel in record numbers following the pandemic.

It’s also clear that if a recession is avoided entirely, consumer credit spending plays a large part in the result. Further, net income increased by 17% during the period.

While many companies are looking for ways to find greater efficiency at the moment, Visa has no such problem. Its bottom line results reflect that truth. Again, there’s no reason to bet against Visa, given consumer credit usage over the past year.

Early expectations suggest that the Vision Pro will be another success for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, it’s unlikely that the Vision Pro will do much to send AAPL stock higher in the near term.

Further, despite strong early pre-release sales, it’s also likely that Vision Pro demand will be limited. Current demand data based on pre-release sales suggest that early enthusiasm is limited to developers and power users.

The Vision Pro was never expected to be a vital contributor to Apple’s top line at any rate. Apple analysts expect the company to easily sell more than 500,000 headsets, priced at $3,500 apiece. That’s not much for a company of Apple’s stature.

iPhone sales continue to be Apple’s bread and butter. Fortunately for Apple investors, there is good news. The iPhone is now the most popular brand in China. That’s particularly good news: Apple had courted other populous Asian nations as China’s economy struggled during 2023.

Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is currently engaged in a period of growth through consolidation. The company recently agreed to purchase Hess (NYSE:HES) for $60 billion.

It’s part of a larger wave of consolidation in the energy sector. It’s also one that has drawn the attention of antitrust investigators. While there is no clear indication of the potential outcome, one thing should be noted.

Large energy firms had a banner year in 2022 after a long dry spell. 2023 was a problematic year again. 2024 is offering signs that are both positive and negative. Demand could remain weak, however, simultaneously, so your political tensions remain high, and crude oil prices have risen lately.

All things considered, it’s fair to argue that Chevron is subject to many factors that could lower its prices. Chevron’s merger with Hess could just as easily go through, and oil prices could rise, ushering in an era of renewed strength. However, the energy sector faces long-term threats worth considering.

Investors have shown a particular interest in dividend stocks over time, primarily because of their ability to generate income. Throughout history, it has been observed that companies characterized by stable and growing dividends tend to yield better returns with lower volatility compared to those that don't distribute dividends. Additionally, investors can enhance their income by reinvesting dividends. A study conducted by Hartford Funds revealed that dating back to 1960, 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 Index can be traced to the impact of reinvested dividends and the compounding effect.

Given the remarkable returns and increasing investor interest, U.S. companies are striving to sustain and expand their dividend payouts. As per the latest findings from S&P Dow Jones Indices, Q4 2023 witnessed 707 instances of dividend increases. The total value of these dividend hikes amounted to $17.5 billion for the quarter, reflecting a rise from the $16.3 billion reported in Q4 2022. The report also highlighted that within the S&P 500, 403 issues, or 80.1%, are currently distributing dividends. This represents an increase from the 401 issues in Q3 2023 and the 399 issues in Q4 2022. Furthermore, among the Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents, 28 out of the 30 companies pay dividends, with an average yield of 2.54% for all issues and 2.72% for those that do distribute dividends.

The positive performance has instilled confidence among analysts, leading them to anticipate a favorable outlook for dividends in 2024. Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, shared insights on the dividend outlook in the firm’s annual report. He said:

“For 2024, the dollar aggregate of dividends is expected to increase once again. Absent an economic or geopolitical event, S&P 500 large caps appear to be weathering volatility better, as the index is expected to post its 15th consecutive year of dividend increases. In addition, the index is also expected to log its 13th consecutive record year, with a 4.5% - 5% increase in payments for 2024, compared to its 5.1% increase in 2023 and its 10.8% increase in 2022. Overall, companies will likely remain cautious in 2024, as they consider both consumer and government spending and also any impact on the political environment.""

2024-01-30T14:06:01+00:00,Buffett Bot’s Best Bets: 3 Top Stock Picks From a Warren-Trained AI Model,"Warren Buffett is often hailed as one of the greatest investors, with a track record that has consistently outpaced the broader markets. Could artificial intelligence (AI) emulate his success? I recently discovered an intriguing AI model called the “Buffett Bot” that was trained to mimic Warren Buffett.

As AI continues making strides across industries, it’s no surprise some clever developers have aimed these analytical engines at the financial markets. And basing one on the Oracle of Omaha himself seems like an especially smart play. Of course, this AI isn’t the real Buffett, but it offers a fascinating glimpse into how modern data science attempts to replicate legendary investors.

I’ll be taking a look at the stock picks recently put forward by this Buffett-inspired AI. The model imitates Buffett’s penchant for finding strong yet reasonably-valued businesses. It will be intriguing to see what kind of companies and sectors the Buffett Bot highlights as solid investments. While this AI is unlikely to fully capture the depth of real-world experience and nuanced judgment behind Buffett’s brilliance, it may still surface some appealing prospects. At the very least, its selections should provide thoughtful food for thought.

Moody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.

Moody’s (NYSE:MCO) holds an enormously influential position in global finance as one of the “Big Three” credit ratings agencies alongside S&P (NYSE:SPGI) and Fitch. This oligopoly enjoys durable competitive advantages from high barriers to entry and a sticky customer base. Thus, I’m not surprised to see Buffett Bot tap Moody’s as a smart Buffett-style bet.

After all, the real Buffett also knows a thing or two about this industry leader – MCO occupies a sizable 2.6% allocation in Berkshire Hathaway’s (NYSE:BRK-B) portfolio. For a man with a highly concentrated portfolio anchored by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), carving out such a large niche for Moody’s signals conviction in its prospects.

Story continues

And why shouldn’t Buffett have this conviction? Moody’s just delivered another quarter of impressive growth in Q3 2023. Revenue grew 15% year-over-year, powered by strong performance across ratings and research, data and analytics, and M&A. Meanwhile, the company’s EBITDA leapt 32%.

No doubt, Moody’s trades at a steep premium. Its shares currently command a valuation of roughly 12-times forward sales and 39-times forward earnings. However, the company’s growth prospects support these rich valuations. Analysts forecast annual earnings per share growth of around 15% over the next five years on the back of near double-digit revenue expansion. In an entrenched triopoly that’s strategically expanding its presence across high-margin adjacencies, I believe Moody’s warrants its above-average multiple.

As an added bonus: Moody’s pays out a small but growing dividend that yields 0.8%. Moody’s offers compelling total return potential as a Buffett-approved blue-chip with fortress positioning in an essential global industry. I agree with the Oracle and his digital doppelgänger that this is a long-term winner.

Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) bam international stocks

While not currently a Berkshire holding, Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM) aligns nicely with the Buffett school of thought. This alternative asset manager focuses on real assets like infrastructure, real estate, renewables, and private equity – tangible categories that benefit society. Its value-based approach centers on acquiring high-quality assets during times of distress or dislocation to generate strong risk-adjusted returns.

In other words, Brookfield brings a long-term lens to its investing framework, and is backed by a strong balance sheet – key “Buffettesque” principles. So, I understand why a digital version of the Oracle tapped Brookfield as an intriguing pick. As attention pivots toward renewable energy and infrastructure spending while real estate rebounds from pandemic lows, this is a company with plenty of tailwinds to consider.

The company’s growth forecasts look promising, too. Brookfield anticipates 17% annualized sales growth over the next two years alongside 19% earnings growth in 2025. While its forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times based on estimated 2024 earnings seems somewhat rich, I believe this premium makes sense for a company eyeing high-teens bottom-line boosts. Plus, shareholders get paid to wait via a 3.2% dividend yield that should keep growing.

I agree with Buffett Bot that BAM stock warrants a spot in a long-term-focused portfolio.

It’s no secret that Buffett largely missed the boat on new tech like AI over the years. But the small Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) position (recently trimmed) in Berkshire’s portfolio proves that even old dogs can learn some new tricks. And while Buffett may not be ready to fully embrace fast-moving tech disruptors, his digital descendant shows more enthusiasm in tapping Amazon’s immense potential.

Now, AMZN stock trades at a nosebleed valuation. Shares of the e-commerce giant currently trade for more than 82-times trailing earnings. But when you dominate the secular growth engines of e-commerce and cloud like Amazon does, lofty multiples feel warranted. Remember, AWS alone commands a 41.5% market share in the cloud, greater than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) combined!

Meanwhile, early pandemic aftershocks to the e-commerce sector have settled, paving the way for growth re-acceleration. Over the last three years, Amazon’s net sales grew outpaced over 84% of marketwide peers. And though its price-earnings ratio seems extremely rich for a company of this scale, it falls below Amazon’s 5-year average near 120-times.

Chicago, IL – January 30, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.

Apple Q1 Earnings: Key Metrics to Watch

It's a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results. The strength of these mega-cap names has been admired by all, with many expecting positive results to keep overall market momentum flowing.

Perhaps the most popular of the bunch, market leader Apple will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market's close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.

Shares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally.

How do expectations stack up heading into the release? Let's take a quick look at headline estimates and a few key other metrics to keep an eye on within the release.

Headline Figures

Analysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year.

Revenue expectations have been revised modestly lower, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period.

Key Metrics

Apple's services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. It includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.

For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion, reflecting 12.5% growth. Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late.

As expected, iPhone revenue will also be a big focus, particularly as the company continues to face competition in other markets. For the quarter, we expect Apple to post $68.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting an increase of roughly 4% year-over-year.

Story continues

iPhone results have been primarily mixed as of late, with the company falling short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases.

Valuation

Shares are trading at a premium relative to historical levels, with the current 28.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting above the 25.2X five-year median. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio sits at 7.4X, near five-year highs and above the 6.0X five-year median.

Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company's dominant stance, as reflected by the share performance.

Bottom Line

We've got a loaded slate of earnings this week, with belovedApple a part of the reporting docket. Earnings estimates have been taken higher whereas revenue expectations have fallen modestly, with both items expected to be higher than the year-ago period.

Investors will closely watch the company's Services results as well as iPhone sales, two key growth drivers for Apple. Heading into the release, the stock is presently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Fed Meet

Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to hold rates steady in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%. According to the CME FedWatch tool, the fed funds futures market has priced in an approximately 97% probability that the central bank will leave rates unchanged during its Wednesday announcement and there’s a 48% probability of a rate cut at the next meeting in March. If the Fed signals a possible rate cut in March, the U.S. dollar will likely weaken against all major currencies. As such, Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP and WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund USDU might experience some declines. These two ETFs are the prime beneficiaries of the rising dollar.

On January 30, Asian stock markets experienced a decline, with China bearing the brunt of the downturn, amid growing concerns among investors. This pessimism in the market is putting pressure on policymakers in China to consider implementing rate cuts in order to stimulate economic growth in the world's second-largest economy. Specifically, stock prices in Hong Kong saw a drop of approximately 2%, while mainland China stocks were on track for a third consecutive day of decline. The recent liquidation order issued against China Evergrande Group on Monday intensified market anxieties, leading to a notable 4% decrease in a Bloomberg index tracking Chinese developers. The Evergrande liquidation saga has cast a shadow over both the Chinese and Hong Kong markets, prompting investors to reassess their positions and adopt a cautious approach. This development underscores the significant influence that regulatory and economic factors in China can have on global financial markets. As market sentiment remains fragile and uncertainty looms, investors are closely monitoring the situation and its potential implications for broader market dynamics. The possibility of rate cuts by Chinese policymakers is being closely watched as investors seek clues about the future direction of economic policy and its impact on market stability.

The oil market remained stable as investors awaited the United States' response to the recent deadly attack on American troops in Jordan, reported Bloomberg. This attack has the potential to escalate tensions in a region crucial to global crude production. Brent crude futures were trading above $82 per barrel following a 1.4% decline on Monday, despite the drone strike targeting US soldiers. Iran has attempted to distance itself from the attack. Additionally, data indicating that OPEC+ is making a sluggish start to implementing new output cuts contributed to downward pressure on oil prices. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) also showed little movement amidst the uncertainty. Oil traders are closely monitoring developments, particularly any indications of the US government's response to the attack. There are concerns that any action taken by the US could further heighten tensions in the region, potentially impacting oil supply and prices. As a result, market participants are proceeding cautiously, awaiting clarity on the situation and its potential implications for the oil market.

Wall Street Analysts See Upside Potential for 10 Stocks with Rising Price Targets

10. Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)

Upside Potential: N/A

On January 29, Barclays analyst Mario Lu reiterated his Underweight rating on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) while adjusting the price target upwards from $100 to $110. This decision comes amidst ongoing scrutiny and cautious sentiment regarding the company's performance and valuation. Despite the upward revision in the price target, Lu maintains a conservative stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) outlook, suggesting that the stock may not offer significant upside potential in the near term. The decision to maintain the Underweight rating indicates Barclays' skepticism about Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) ability to justify its current valuation. The revised price target of $110 suggests that Barclays anticipates limited growth prospects for Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), especially considering the prevailing market conditions and the company's financial performance. While the price target raise acknowledges certain positive factors, such as the company's strong brand recognition and market presence, it also underscores the cautious approach taken by analysts like Lu. As of the closing bell on January 29, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) stock was trading at $152.70, reflecting the market's reaction to the revised price target and Barclays' assessment of the company's valuation.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“The largest relative detractors in the quarter were Illumina, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), and Microsoft. Airbnb continues to deliver double-digit growth in revenue and nights booked, which is especially impressive given the year-ago growth rates it delivered on these same metrics (+29% and +31, respectively). Despite these attractive results, the stock sold off as investors reacted to fourth quarter guidance that came in slightly below expectations. Coming into the fourth quarter, the stock was up +60% on the back of strong fundamentals. Stepping back, nothing has changed. Private rentals continue to take market share from hotels globally, and Airbnb continues to take market share within private rentals given its relentless focus on improving the guest and host experience. Looking ahead, we expect many years of robust earnings and cash flow growth from here.”

09. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

Upside Potential: 4%

On January 29, Baird analyst William Power increased the price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $186.00 to $200.00, affirming an Outperform rating. This adjustment reflects Baird's optimistic outlook on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) performance and potential within the technology sector. With a revised price target suggesting a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, the analyst's move indicates confidence in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ability to continue delivering value to investors. The decision to maintain the Outperform rating underscores Baird's belief in Apple's strong position in the industry and its ability to outperform market expectations. The raised price target of $200.00 reflects Baird's positive assessment of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth prospects, innovation pipeline, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, making it an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was trading at $191.73, indicating a modest premium over the revised price target set by Baird.

Polen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA alone drove over 1,100 basis points of the Russell 1000 Growth Index’s 42% return, so not owning them was a meaningful headwind to our relative return in 2023. While on a total attribution basis, Apple was not a top three detractor to our full-year return, given its extremely large weighting in the Index, we feel it’s worth sharing our thoughts.

The company’s share price appreciated nearly 50% in a year when its revenue declined and earnings per share was relatively flat with the previous year.

For 2024, consensus expectations are for low-single-digit revenue growth and only slightly faster EPS growth. These pedestrian growth rates are not surprising for a company with nearly $400 billion in annual revenue. What is more surprising is that Apple shares trade at nearly 30x forward earnings, a large premium to the market and many faster-growing, competitively advantaged businesses.

While we continue to think Apple is a wonderful business, it is also a slow growing one with risks that we do not see as insignificant. Apple’s entire supply chain is based in China and much of its incremental revenue growth also comes from China, so if there is a U.S.-China issue that makes it more difficult for U.S.-based companies that have access to large amounts of local data to operate in China, Apple’s business would likely face more challenges than many others. In addition, much of Apple’s services growth and margin expansion has come from direct payments from Google to be the default search provider on iOS devices. This practice is currently the subject of a lawsuit between Google and the U.S. Justice Department. If this practice is deemed unlawful, it could take away a large and highly profitable revenue stream from Apple’s already slow growth engine. While we closely cover Apple, we continue to believe we have better investment opportunities. Apple’s current P/E is above our Portfolio’s weighted average, yet its long-term earnings growth rate is likely to be lower than even our slowest growing holding, according to our research.”

08. Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU)

Upside Potential: 4%

On January 29, Oppenheimer analyst Scott Schneeberger increased the price target for Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) from $610.00 to $678.00, upholding an Outperform rating. This adjustment underscores Oppenheimer's positive outlook on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) prospects within the software and financial technology industry. With the revised price target indicating a 4% upside potential compared to the current market price, Schneeberger's move reflects confidence in Intuit's ability to deliver value to investors. Maintaining the Outperform rating signals Oppenheimer's belief in Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) competitive positioning and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $678.00 reflects Oppenheimer's bullish stance on Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) long-term growth prospects, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It suggests that the company's stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) stock was trading at $652.88, indicating a slight premium over the revised price target set by Oppenheimer.

L1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Following significant under-performance, some high-quality businesses in these sectors are now becoming more attractive from a valuation perspective – in our language they are now getting warmer on our Bench of potential investments.

Our ‘all-weather’ portfolio centred around our unique definition of ‘quality’ delivered strong performance in the September quarter. Three companies positively contributed over 0.5% (in Australian dollars) to the Fund’s returns for the quarter (Booking Holdings, Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Natural Resource Partners, in alphabetical order), and another three companies almost reached this level of positive contribution. No companies detracted from the Portfolio’s returns by 0.5% or more.

As part of our travels during the quarter (see page 6) we had the opportunity to meet with management of both Booking Holdings and Intuit. We continue to view both companies as exceptionally well managed.

Intuit held its annual Investor Day during the quarter and the presentation materials are well-worth a review. Intuit is at the forefront of commercial application of artificial intelligence (AI) across its portfolio of businesses – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. Intuit has been investing in AI for many years, well before ChatGPT became a buzz word…” (Click here to read the full text)

07. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)

Upside Potential: 7%

On January 29, Keybanc analyst Justin Patterson increased the price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from $153 to $165 while affirming an Overweight rating. This adjustment reflects Keybanc's optimistic outlook on Alphabet's prospects within the technology and internet services industry. With the revised price target suggesting a 7% upside potential compared to the current market price, Patterson's decision underscores confidence in Alphabet's ability to generate value for investors. By maintaining the Overweight rating, Keybanc expresses its conviction in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) competitive position and growth trajectory. The raised price target of $165 reflects Keybanc's bullish perspective on Alphabet's long-term growth potential, innovative product offerings, and financial performance. It indicates that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting an attractive investment opportunity for shareholders. At the closing time on January 29, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock was trading at $153.51, signaling a slight premium over the revised price target set by Keybanc. This adjustment is expected to influence investor sentiment and contribute to ongoing discussions about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) position as a leading player in the technology and internet services market.

06. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)

Upside Potential: 9%

On January 29, Morgan Stanley raised its target price on Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) shares from $39.00 to $48.00, while maintaining an ""equal weight"" rating. This adjustment reflects Morgan Stanley's assessment of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) position within the semiconductor industry and its outlook for the company's future performance. With the revised target price suggesting a 9% upside potential compared to the current market price, Morgan Stanley's decision underscores a moderate level of optimism regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) prospects. By maintaining an ""equal weight"" rating, Morgan Stanley acknowledges Intel's strengths and weaknesses relative to its peers in the industry. This rating suggests that Intel's performance is expected to align with the broader market trends, without significant outperformance or underperformance. The raised target price of $48.00 reflects Morgan Stanley's belief in Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) ability to execute its strategic initiatives and drive shareholder value over the long term. It indicates that Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock is undervalued relative to its potential, presenting a favorable investment opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the semiconductor sector. As of the closing bell on January 29, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) stock was trading at $43.84, indicating a potential upside from the revised target price set by Morgan Stanley.

Upslope Capital Management stated the following regarding Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”

2024-01-30T11:00:32+00:00,Why Netflix took the pressure off the 'Magnificent 7' ahead of earnings,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:

The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings

There's a lot riding on results from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) out later today.

But the market's reaction to last week's earnings report from Netflix (NFLX) may have eased the pressure on what members of the ""Magnificent Seven"" have in store for investors this week.

Data from FactSet highlighted by Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer in Sunday's Morning Brief showed how much heavy lifting the Magnificent Seven companies, minus Tesla (TSLA), are expected to do for the S&P 500 this earnings season.

This group of six companies — Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft, and Nvidia (NVDA) — are expected to report earnings growth north of 50% during the fourth quarter. The rest of the index should see earnings, collectively, fall 10.4% from the same quarter last year.

Were the company to have missed these growth targets and cautioned on the benefits these initiatives are providing in pursuit of this target, investors may have judged the stock more harshly.

Aggregate tailwinds can only take a stock so far. Ultimately, management needs to deliver on its promises.

But the reception Netflix earned from the Street shows the willingness investors have in this environment to reward execution.

With 25% of the S&P 500 having reported earnings through last Friday, John Butters's team at FactSet found earnings beats are being rewarded more than average while misses are being penalized less than average.

And how this trend holds up as the remaining 75% of the index reports over the coming weeks might have more to say about the market's overall direction than results from the companies most responsible for actual earnings growth.

2024-01-30T00:00:11+00:00,Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Vision Pro Is a Potential Silver Lining,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of the largest manufacturers of high-tech devices in the world, has faced scrutiny for failing to launch a blockbuster product in recent years. The Apple Vision Pro, the company’s first virtual reality headset, is widely seen as a potential silver lining that could become the biggest product launch since AirPods.

The Apple Vision Pro will be available for purchase in the U.S. starting on February 2, and the company is yet to announce an international launch date. Although I am beginning to be optimistic about what’s in store for Apple this year, I am neutral on AAPL stock, nonetheless.

Looking Beyond Encouraging Demand Trends

The Apple Vision Pro has been available for pre-order since January 19, starting at a price of $3,499 for the 256 GB version. For comparison, Oculus Quest 3, the latest AR headset developed and sold by Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), starts at $499 for the 128 GB version. The hefty price of the Apple Vision Pro raised concerns when the product was unveiled last June, but data from the first weekend of pre-order availability suggests strong initial demand.

According to popular Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple sold between 160,000 and 180,000 Vision Pro units during the first pre-order weekend, which suggests the device was sold out, as expected, within the first weekend itself. As the analyst observed and reported, expected shipping times for all Vision Pro devices extended to five to seven weeks immediately after pre-ordering was enabled – a clear indication that the Vision Pro was sold out.

There is, however, a major difference between blockbuster iPhone models and the Vision Pro. Typically, iPhones see a steady rise in shipping times for at least 48 hours after the availability of pre-ordering, but Vision Pro shipping times remained steady in the first 48 hours after the initial burst. This, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, serves as a warning sign.

Apple has a cult-like follower base that lines up to purchase new devices as and when they are released. A blockbuster product will not only attract this strong follower base but will also appeal to the masses. The waning demand for the Vision Pro after an initial burst suggests the VR headsets are yet to attract mass tech consumers.

The AR/VR Market Has Room for Disruption

Empirical evidence suggests that Apple has been wildly successful in aggressively gaining market share in various consumer tech niches such as smartphones, personal computers, and smart watches despite not enjoying first-mover advantages in any of these markets. Apple’s success stems from the company’s proven ability to develop appealing tech products based on a deep understanding of consumer preferences.

Today, the AR/VR headset market is at an infant stage, with IDC projecting just 8.1 million AR/VR device shipments in 2023. According to Counterpoint Research, Meta dominated this market in the third quarter of 2023, accounting for 49% of all device shipments. Counterpoint data reveals that headset shipments plummeted by 29% year-over-year in Q3 due to a lack of compelling headset launches.

The relatively small size of the AR/VR headset market leaves ample room for disruption, and Apple has a reputation for successfully exploiting similar opportunities in other market segments.

Apple’s Scale Problem

Apple has grown in leaps and bounds since the first-ever iPhone was released in 2007. The massive size and scale of the company, however, has made it difficult for Apple to meet Wall Street’s growth expectations in recent years. For context, in Fiscal 2023, total revenue declined close to 3% year-over-year to $383 billion, while net income also declined by 2.8%.

The problem with Apple’s massive scale is that it takes a wildly successful product to move the needle for the company from a financial performance perspective. In 2024, Apple expects to sell 500,000 Vision Pro units, bringing in revenue of at least $1.75 billion. This may seem like an encouraging figure in isolation, but in comparison to the almost $400 billion in revenue Apple is projected to bring in this year, Vision Pro sales seem trivial.

Even if Apple sells double the projected Vision Pro units for 2024, this segment will still account for less than 1% of total company sales this year. Going by this understanding, it seems fair to conclude that Vision Pro will fail to meaningfully impact Apple’s fundamentals in the foreseeable future.

The highly anticipated VR headset, however, has the potential to improve the market sentiment toward Apple and ascertain the company’s position as a dominant tech innovator if unit sales exceed Wall Street expectations this year.

Is Apple Stock a Buy, According to Wall Street Analysts?

Apple is one of the most followed companies in the market. Not surprisingly, Wall Street analysts are often divided about Apple’s prospects, but they’re currently bullish overall. The stock earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. Here’s what some analysts have said about Apple.

On January 18, Bank of America Securities upgraded Apple and raised the stock’s price target from $208 to $225, citing the company’s promising AI product roadmap, among other bullish developments such as the improved outlook for the services segment. BofA also claimed that Vision Pro sales could eventually surpass iPad revenue in the long run, with VR going mainstream.

On January 23, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) added Apple to its US 1 list, which is a collection of the bank’s best investment ideas.

Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), in its Weekly Warm-Up Report, published on January 22, identified Apple as one of the top high-quality growth stocks in the U.S. among 56 other companies that are seemingly well-positioned to deliver alpha returns this year.

Last week, Piper Sandler highlighted Apple as the 3rd most attractive pick out of Magnificent 7 stocks, behind Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms.

Overall, based on the ratings of 31 Wall Street analysts, the average Apple stock price target is $205.85, which implies upside of 7.5% from the current market price.

The Takeaway: Vision Pro is Exciting, Apple’s Valuation Is Not

Apple is heading into exciting days, with the first batch of Vision Pro units expected to be shipped out in the coming weeks. Although the Vision Pro may not have a strong impact on Apple’s earnings this year, the market may reward Apple handsomely if the device attracts tech bulls and positive reviews from tech enthusiasts. Apple, however, looks expensively valued at a forward P/E of 29 compared to its five-year average of 25.

2024-01-29T21:51:00+00:00,Apple Q1 Earnings: Key Metrics to Watch,"It’s a highly critical week for earnings, with several mega-cap technology companies slated to reveal quarterly results. The strength of these mega-cap names has been admired by all, with many expecting positive results to keep overall market momentum flowing.

Perhaps the most popular of the bunch, market leader Apple AAPL will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.

Shares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally. Zacks Investment Research

How do expectations stack up heading into the release? Let’s take a quick look at headline estimates and a few key other metrics to keep an eye on within the release.

Headline Figures

Analysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research

Revenue expectations have been revised modestly lower, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period. Zacks Investment Research

Key Metrics

Apple’s services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. It includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.

For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion, reflecting 12.5% growth. Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late, as we can see below. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

As expected, iPhone revenue will also be a big focus, particularly as the company continues to face competition in other markets. For the quarter, we expect Apple to post $68.6 billion in iPhone revenue, suggesting an increase of roughly 4% year-over-year.

Story continues

iPhone results have been primarily mixed as of late, with the company falling short of consensus expectations in back-to-back releases. Zacks Investment Research

Valuation

Shares are trading at a premium relative to historical levels, with the current 28.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple sitting above the 25.2X five-year median. The forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio sits at 7.4X, near five-year highs and above the 6.0X five-year median.

Still, investors have had little issue forking up the premium given the company’s dominant stance, as reflected by the share performance. Zacks Investment Research Zacks Investment Research

Bottom Line

We’ve got a loaded slate of earnings this week, with beloved Apple AAPL a part of the reporting docket. Earnings estimates have been taken higher whereas revenue expectations have fallen modestly, with both items expected to be higher than the year-ago period.

Investors will closely watch the company’s Services results as well as iPhone sales, two key growth drivers for Apple. Heading into the release, the stock is presently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2024-01-29T19:05:15+00:00,Paddy Power owner plans to quit FTSE 100 in fresh blow to London,"Flutter has said it will make New York its primary listing in a blow to the London Stock Exchange - Hollie Adams/Bloomberg

The owner of Paddy Power is poised to quit the FTSE 100 and shift its main listing to New York, delivering a fresh blow to London’s struggling stock market.

Flutter, which also owns PokerStars and Betfair, said on Monday it now sees the US as its “natural home” and will now work towards shifting its primary listing to New York.

While it would retain a secondary share listing in London, the shift would likely make Flutter ineligible for inclusion on FTSE indexes.

Flutter, which is worth £28.9bn, announced plans to pursue a secondary listing in the US last year and shares debuted on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Monday.

However, the company has upgraded its US ambitions following discussions with shareholders. Flutter will ask shareholders to vote on the plan at its AGM in May, with the move expected to take effect over the summer if it is approved.

Peter Jackson, Flutter’s chief executive, said: “With our NYSE listing effective today, this is a pivotal moment for the group as we make Flutter more accessible to US based investors and gain access to deeper capital markets.”

As well as Flutter, Irish construction group CRH last year shifted from London to New York and the British stock market missed out on the $54bn initial public offering (IPO) of Cambridge-chipmaker Arm.

The number of requests to float on the London Stock Exchange’s main market has plunged to its lowest level in at least six years, according to Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) data, while the number of companies listed on the stock market has shrunk by more than 25pc over the last decade, according to research from trading platform XTB.

Flutter is focusing on the US amid an explosion in gambling there spurred by a Supreme Court decision in 2018. The decision effectively ended a ban on sports betting at a federal level in every state but Nevada and has sparked a rapid expansion in the industry. US gambling revenues hit $16.2bn (£12.8bn) in the third quarter of 2023, according to the American Gaming Association.

Story continues

While it is best known for running the high street bookie Paddy Power in the UK, Flutter also owns a majority stake in FanDuel, one of the US’s biggest sports betting firms. The US accounts for around 40pc of its business and sales there grew by 38pc to £3.6bn in 2023.

Mr Jackson said: “We believe a US primary listing is the natural home for Flutter given FanDuel’s No. 1 position in the US, a market which we expect to contribute the largest proportion of profits in the near future.”

BAE-backed airline to float in London next month

An airline jointly owned by BAE Systems and the Kazakhstan government says it will raise up to £757m when it floats in both London and Kazakhstan next month.

Air Astana, the flag carrier of Kazakhstan, is 49pc owned by BAE, which invested in the airline as it started trading after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It now has over 40 aircraft and more than 5,000 staff.

In 2022, it posted a profit of $78.4m (£61.7m) on a turnover of $1.03bn (£812m).

Peter Foster, chief executive, said that there had been strong investor interest in the flotation “supported by strong financial and operational track record, significant growth opportunities, and an experienced, disciplined management team”.

Apple accuses Home Office of ‘unprecedented overreach’ in row over spying laws

Apple has accused the Home office of an “unprecedented overreach” in an escalating row over new spying laws, reports James Titcomb.

The iPhone maker said it was “deeply concerned” about changes to security legislation that would give the Home Secretary stronger powers over encrypted messaging apps.

Apple has previously warned that the legislation could lead to apps such as FaceTime and iMessage being removed from the UK.

The Home Office is amending the Investigatory Powers Act, which gives the Government powers to force messaging apps to break encryption.

The new rules, branded a snooper’s charter by critics, will require tech companies to inform the Home Secretary before they make changes affecting apps’ security.

They would also allow the Government to secretly apply its powers to companies based overseas, which Apple said could prevent it from applying security updates around the world.

In a statement ahead of the final debate of the amended bill in the House of Lords on Tuesday, Apple said: “Protecting our users’ privacy and the security of their data is at the very heart of everything we do at Apple.

“We’re deeply concerned that the proposed amendments to the Investigatory Powers Act now before Parliament place users’ privacy and security at risk.

“It’s an unprecedented overreach by the government and, if enacted, the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.”

Apple and WhatsApp, which make the two most popular encrypted messaging apps, have warned that they would withdraw their services from the UK rather than comply with orders to weaken the protections.

The Government has made minor concessions on the new laws, but tech groups have continued to oppose the core changes to the legislation.

The third reading in the House of Lords on Tuesday will be followed by scrutiny in the Commons, although the legislation is likely to go through, given it is supported by the two major parties.

A Government spokesperson said: “The first job of government is to keep the country safe and as technology advances and changes, so do the threats that the UK faces.

“We have always been clear that we support technological innovation and private and secure communications technologies, including end-to-end encryption, but this cannot come at a cost to public safety.

“It is critical that decisions about lawful access, which protect the country from child sexual abusers and terrorists, are taken by those who are democratically accountable and approved by Parliament.”

Brakes slam on new EU trade deal after farmer protests

Emmanuel Macron, the French president, has told the European Commission that it is impossible to conclude trade deal negotiations with South America’s Mercosur common market, Reuters has reported.

Farmers have staged massive protests in France over the past few weeks, angry about rising costs and cheap imports, following similar action in other European countries, including Germany and Poland.

Farmers in France have  objected to ongoing talks on a trade deal between the EU and Mercosur nations, which they say would allow cheap food imports that do not meet strict EU standards.

President Macron “has very firmly reiterated to the Commission the fact it was impossible to conclude talks in these conditions,” a French presidential adviser told reporters in a briefing ahead of an EU summit on Thursday.

The adviser added that the EU understood it was impossible to reach a deal in this context and that EU talks with Mercosur countries had been stopped. He said:

The European Commission had understood it was impossible to reach a deal in this context. I think it has seen the situation in France, in Germany, in Poland, in the Netherlands, across Europe.

It is our understanding it has instructed its negotiators to put an end to the negotiation session underway in Brazil and in particular cancel the visit of the Commission’s vice-president that had been envisaged in view of a conclusion

Tesla rival BYD drives profits higher

Profits at Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD soared in 2023, according to preliminary results released today.

The group said that it expects profit for last year to fall between 29 and 31 billion yuan (£3.2bn to £3.4bn) - an increase of between 74.5 and 86.5 percent as compared with the year before, the company said.

BYD is expected to publish final figures in the coming weeks.

The Shenzhen-based company overtook Elon Musk’s Tesla in the fourth quarter of 2023 to become the world’s top seller of electric vehicles.

BYD (“Build Your Dreams”), which began in 1995 as a battery manufacturer before pivoting in the early 2000s to hybrid and all-electric vehicles, has capitalized on Beijing’s strong government support for the burgeoning sector.

Despite losing its quarterly sales crown, Tesla was still on top on an annual basis, delivering more than 1.8 million EVs to customers in the year to December, up 38 percent.

This was well above BYD’s sales figure of just under 1.6 million, which represented a 73 percent year-on-year increase.

IMF gives Argentina's 'Thatcher' more breathing room

The International Monetary Fund is giving Argentina a two-month extension before it reviews its $44bn (£38bn) loan to the country, in a move that gives the South American country’s free-market government extra time to apply its reforms and show progress.

IMF officials have agreed to move the review from September to November, according to a Reuters report.

Javier Milei, the newly elected president of Argentina, who has described Margaret Thatcher as one of “the great leaders in the history of humanity”, rode to power on the back of voter anger at the worsening economic situation.

Argentina struggled in 2023 to repay the IMF, resorting to deals with China and with Qatar to make ends meet.

Vaping company shares recover from plunge as critics round on ban

Shares in vaping supplier Supreme have rebounded during today, despite the Government’s plans to ban disposable vapes.

The importer of vaping products, batteries and light fittings issued a trading update noting that it had already been limiting its disposable vaping product range “as part of an ongoing commitment to eradicate underage vaping”.

The company pointed to its scale in reusable vaping and said that “none of these revenue streams are expected to be adversely affected by the changes proposed by the Government”.

The company also announced a share buyback and said that its trading was significantly ahead of expectations.

Shares, which were down 16pc just after the market opened this morning are up 6.67pc.

Meanwhile, the ban on disposable vapes has received a backlash from free-marketeers and anti-smoking campaigners alike.

Reem Ibrahim of the Institute of Economic Affairs said:

Banning a product for everyone, just because it is sometimes consumed by people who are already banned from buying it, is an incredibly poor basis for legislation.

Clive Bates, the former Director of Action on Smoking and Health, said:

This will trigger more smoking, more illicit trade and more workarounds. The problem of youth vaping is a non-problem and the government is reacting to a moral panic it doesn’t understand.

Britain considers backing microchip technology favoured by China

Ministers are considering supporting a microchip technology favoured by China and seen as a national security issue in the US. James Titcomb reports:

The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology plans to canvas semiconductor companies about whether it should participate in developing a microchip design known as RISC-V.

The chip architecture, pronounced “risk five”, is attracting growing interest among technology businesses around the world but has been particularly welcomed in China as a potential way to blunt the effects of US chip sanctions.

It is developed as an “open” standard, meaning the technology is free to use and available to all, and so is not subject to US export rules.

RISC-V is also seen as a growing threat to Arm, Britain’s biggest technology company, whose designs are predominantly used in the sort of low-energy microchips that RISC-V works on.

RISC-V International has hundreds of members including major companies like Google and Intel. Its members also include the Chinese Academy of Sciences alongside tech companies such as Huawei.

US politicians have called on the White House to impose restrictions around RISC-V over concerns it could be used by Beijing.

A group of Republican and Democrat Members of Congress wrote to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in November, saying: “While the benefits of open-source collaboration on RISC-V promise to be significant, it can only be realised when contributors are working with the sole aim of improving the technology, and not aiding the geopolitical interests of the PRC.”

RISC-V International has pushed back on the calls. It said in October: “Contemplated actions by governments for an unprecedented restriction in open standards will have the consequence of diminished access to the global marketplace of products, solutions, and talent.”

A Government spokesman said: “Semiconductors underpin our economy and national security, as well as being vital to our technology superpower ambitions. It is crucial we have a comprehensive understanding of the risks and benefits developments in this field pose to the UK, including in RISC-V.

“Acknowledging that RISC-V’s open nature presents risks to manage around security, we have been clear in our Semiconductor Strategy, published in May last year, that it offers significant opportunities for innovation in the industry.” RISC-V is seen as a growing threat to Arm - Bloomberg

Markets become less confident about US interest rate cuts

The dollar rose on Monday as investors prepared for the prospect that the Federal Reserve could push back against expectations of an imminent rate cut when it concludes its two-day meeting on Wednesday, and amid doveish comments from two European central bankers.

The Fed is expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday and investors will focus on comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, after he indicated in December that the Fed is moving towards a programme of cutting interest rates.

Helen Given, foreign exchange trader at Monex USA in Washington DC, said:

The [macroeconomic] picture in the US looks a lot better than the macro picture in European Union countries and the eurozone in general.

We’ll probably see a bit of pushback on the last meeting. I’d expect that a lot of the dollar strength that we’re seeing today, and we should continue to see until that decision release on Wednesday, is coming from shifting expectations.

Euro under pressure after doveish comments from central bankers

The euro has dropped slightly in trading today, down 0.37pc against the dollar and 0.20pc against the pound, after doveish comments from a couple of the European Central Bank’s governing council.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, explains:

Portuguese ECB governing council member [Mario] Centeno said that rate cuts should start sooner rather than later so that the process is gradual, without any need to wait for wages data. His comments were followed by Slovakia member Peter Kazimir who argued that rate cuts were also on the horizon although his confidence over timing was less fixed, but that June was more likely than April.

BT accused of ripping off elderly landline customers in landmark court case

BT has been accused of ripping off elderly landline customers in a landmark £1.3bn court case. James Warrington reports:

The telecoms giant is facing a class action lawsuit over claims it “systematically” overcharged around 3m customers – many of whom are elderly – on their landline bills.

The case, led by former Ofcom executive Justin Le Patourel, accuses BT of consistently increasing prices even as its own costs were falling.

If successful, affected customers could be owed damages of between £300 and £400.

Mr Le Patourel said: “We believe BT has been systematically overcharging millions of customers over many years, and those customers could be owed hundreds of pounds each.”

The first trial, which covers around 1.5m customers, began in the Competition Appeals Tribunal today.

The trial is expected to last eight weeks, with a judgement before the end of the year.

The legal action is centred on a 2017 Ofcom ruling, which found BT had been overcharging landline customers since 2009.

The former monopoly agreed to cut bills by £7 per month from April 2018, but did not compensate customers for past overcharging.

The first group in the class action lawsuit are “voice only” customers who had a BT landline service between October 2015 and April 2018.

Ofcom has previously said that these customers were more likely to be old, on low incomes or vulnerable.

The second group of around 2m customers had a BT landline service alongside broadband between October 2015 and December 2023, bundling these services together into a single, discounted package.

Mr Le Patourel said the case was particularly urgent given the age of many of the claimants. More than half a million affected customers have already passed away, though their estates will be entitled to apply for compensation if the case is successful.

A spokesman for BT said: “We take our responsibilities to customers very seriously and are dedicated to keeping our customers connected, while helping those who need it most. This claim relates to a technical landline pricing issue which was resolved by Ofcom in 2017.

“We do not accept that our pricing was anti-competitive back then, and as such are committed to robustly defending our position at trial.” A BT shop in London - Rasid Necati Aslim/Anadolu via Getty Images

Flutter departure delivers latest blow to London markets

The decision to shift Flutter’s focus to the US is a further blow to the London Stock Exchange, which has seen a string of companies decamp to New York and has struggled to attract high-profile new listings, writes Daniel Woolfson.

As well as Flutter, Irish construction group CRH last year shifted from London to New York and the British stock market missed out on the $54bn initial public offering (IPO) of Cambridge-chipmaker Arm.

The number of requests to float on the London Stock Exchange’s main market has plunged to its lowest level in at least six years, according to Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) data, while the number of companies listed on the stock market has shrunk by more than 25pc over the last decade, according to research from trading platform XTB.

Flutter is focusing on the US amid an explosion in gambling there spurred by a Supreme Court decision in 2018. The decision effectively ended a ban on sports betting at a federal level in every state but Nevada and has sparked a rapid expansion in the industry. US gambling revenues hit $16.2bn (£12.8bn) in the third quarter of 2023, according to the American Gaming Association.

While it is best known for running the high street bookie Paddy Power in the UK, Flutter also owns a majority stake in FanDuel, one of the US’s biggest sports betting firms. The US accounts for around 40pc of its business and sales there grew by 38pc to £3.6bn in 2023.

Mr Jackson said: “We believe a US primary listing is the natural home for Flutter given FanDuel’s No. 1 position in the US, a market which we expect to contribute the largest proportion of profits in the near future.”

Shares in London Stock Exchange Group have fallen 1.5pc today.

German department store KaDeWe files for bankruptcy

KaDeWe Group, which operates the eponymous Berlin department store, said it has filed for insolvency, marking the latest fallout of a widening property crisis in the region.

KaDeWe, which is part of the troubled Signa real estate empire, is a landmark tourist destination in Berlin, and the group also includes the Oberpollinger department store in Munich and the Alsterhaus in Hamburg.

Signa, the insolvent Austrian-based property empire that has become the biggest casualty so far in Europe’s real-estate crisis, bought KaDeWe as part of a retail portfolio a decade ago.

In 2015, Signa sold a majority stake to the Thai retail conglomerate Central Group.

Since the Signa holding company filed for insolvency last year, many of its divisions have followed suit.

KaDeWe, stands for Kaufhaus Des Westens and is pronounced kah-day-vay, will remain open.

Since it opened in 1907, the building on Wittenberg Platz, not far from the Zoologischer Garten railway station, has become a symbol of the German capital to rival the Brandenburg Gate and the television tower at Alexander Platz.

Jimi Hendrix bassist and drummer's estates sue Sony in row over album rights

Companies created by the descendants of Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell will be allowed to seek a share of the copyright to the three albums by The Jimi Hendrix Experience, following a High Court ruling.

Redding and Mitchell jointed the The Jimi Hendrix Experience in 1966 and played on the group’s three studio albums “Are You Experienced”, “Axis: Bold As Love” and “Electric Ladyland”, released in 1967 and 1968.

The recordings feature “Hey Joe”, “Purple Haze”, “Foxy Lady”, “The Wind Cries Mary” and other hits that helped usher in the psychedelic music age and made Hendrix a rock icon before his death in 1970 aged 27.

Redding and Mitchell died in 2003 and 2008 respectively and their descendents later assigned any rights they might have had in the albums to two companies.

The companies – Noel Redding Estate Ltd and Mitch Mitchell Estate Ltd – sued Sony in 2022 and are seeking a declaration that they own a share of the sound recording copyrights of the albums in which the pair feature.

But Judge Michael Green ruled today that the lawsuit should be heard at a full trial, which will likely take place in 2025. Jimi Hendrix with Mitch Mitchell, left, and Noel Redding in Germany in 1967 - Gunter Zint/K & K Ulf Kruger OHG/Redferns

Wall Street bank criticised over evidence failures in $1bn battle with Mike Ashley

Morgan Stanley has been criticised for failing to hand over evidence in its $1bn legal battle over Mike Ashley’s share dealings.

Our professional services reporter Adam Mawardi has the latest:

The High Court is seeking answers from the Wall Street banking giant after it claimed to have belatedly discovered a document relating to its $995m (£783m) margin call against the retail billionaire.

This is the latest twist in Frasers Group’s €50m case against Morgan Stanley, which is accused of  “arbitrarily” and “incorrectly” closing out bets on Hugo Boss stock, losing the listed company millions of pounds in the process.

Morgan Stanley forced through its margin call from Frasers in May 2021, as it sought cover against Mr Ashley’s stake in Hugo Boss.

Amazon pulls £1.1bn iRobot takeover over EU investigation

Amazon has abandoned its $1.5bn (£1.1bn) acquisition of robot vacuum maker iRobot after clashing with EU regulators who had threatened to block the deal.

The tech giant’s decision to end the takeover pursuit announced in August last year will cost it $94m in termination fees to the Roomba manufacturer.

Last year the European Commission said it would open an in-depth probe into the deal and warned that it could reduce competition. The UK Competition and Markets Authority gave the takeover the all clear.

Flutter to begin trading on 'natural home' New York Stock Exchange

No 10 disappointed train companies not enforcing minimum service levels

Downing Street has expressed disappointment at rail operators who are not using minimum service levels legislation during train strikes.

Commuters are facing another wave of industrial action and rail disruption this week, as train drivers hold rolling walkouts and a ban on overtime.

The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “It’s something the rail operators called for many months ago and the public would rightly expect them to be used if strike action is taking place.”

Asked if No 10 is disappointed with the operators, he said:

Yes, it’s something that we and the public expect them to use.

It’s ultimately up to train operators to effectively manage their services, we have been as clear as possible that they should be as ready to use all powers available to them to reduce the impact of rail strikes on passengers.

Lloyds scraps fleet of mobile van branches in blow to face-to-face banking

Lloyds is ending its mobile banking van service in a blow to thousands who have already lost their last remaining bank branch.

Our money reporter Ruby Hinchliffe has the details:

The banking van service was set up to serve rural towns and villages where Lloyds had shut the local branch, visiting 170 locations every fortnight.

Some 6,500 customers relied on these vans to withdraw cash, make deposits and cash in cheques.

But Lloyds said “following an in-depth review”, banking vans will cease to exist from May 31, 2024.

It put the decision down to customers “using them less” and “choosing other ways to bank instead”.

Inflation to fall to 2pc in second quarter of this year, says City bank

Inflation will fall to 2pc during the second quarter of the year, a City bank has predicted, joining the wave of economists saying price rises will slow markedly in the near term.

Citi said the imminent danger from inflation is “fading” although its admitted there were “lingering risks” about price rises in the longer term.

Chief UK economist Ben Nabarro suggested the Bank of England could take a “more balanced” view about the economy when it comes to setting interest rates.

He said: “For the MPC, we think these data suggest scope for less pervasive inflationary aversion, and a more balanced view of the economic risks.”

It comes after economists at Deutsche Bank predicted inflation will fall below 2pc by April or May this year, down sharply from the 4pc recorded for December.

Wall Street poised for slow start to busy week

The main US stock indexes are poised for a subdued start to the week ahead of a series major events including the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.

Wall Street has been on a record-breaking rally, with the S&P 500 closing at all time highs five times this month.

Even though investors rejoiced a continued moderation in US prices on Friday, the enthusiasm was curbed by Intel’s bleak first-quarter revenue outlook, pushing the S&P 500 and Nasdaq to close lower on the day.

Microsoft, Alphabet, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and other major companies such as Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Qualcomm , Merck, Pfizer and Boeing will start reporting earnings from Tuesday.

Larry Adam, chief investment officer, Private Client Group, said:

With the market at record highs and valuations near the upper-end of its range over the last 20 years, any disappointments from the MAGMAN (big tech) names will likely lead to increased volatility over the coming weeks.

“Despite a lowered bar, it has been a fairly lackluster start to 4Q23 earnings as the percentage of companies beating on the top and bottom line have been below the historical average, and the magnitude of beats is at the lowest level since 2008.

Eurozone interest rate cuts more likely in June, says ECB policymaker

The European Central Bank is more likely to begin cutting interest rates from June, rather than April, according to a policymaker.

Writing for Bloomberg, Governing Council member Peter Kazimir said:

Acting hastily based on short-term surprises without having more clarity about the medium term would be risky.

It could easily derail the progress we have made toward reaching our target.

I am confident that the exact timing, whether in April or June, is secondary to the decision’s impact.

The latter seems more probable, but I will not jump to premature conclusions about the timing. As soon as it is warranted, we won’t hesitate to act.

Vape shares plunge as PM sets out tobacco ban plan

Shares in a vape distributor Chill Brands Group plunged today after Rishi Sunak has set out plans to get rid of disposable vapes to protect children’s health as he faces a backlash from the Tory right over his proposed tobacco sale ban.

During a school visit today, the Prime Minister said he was taking “strong action” to “stamp out” youth vaping, following a public consultation on the issue in which almost 70pc of respondents were in favour of a ban.

Pound strengthens ahead of interest rate decision

The pound has strengthened slightly ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision due on Thursday.

Sterling was flat against the dollar at $1.27 but was up 0.3pc against the euro, which is worth 85p.

It comes as the Bank of England is expected to hold interest rates at their 16-year highs of 5.25pc later this week, while the US Federal Reserve is also expected to leave its borrowing costs unchanged from their 23-year highs.

The European Central Bank last week held interest rates at a record-high 4pc and reaffirmed its commitment to fighting inflation.

However, traders are piling on bets that the ECB will cut interest rates from April, with nearly 140 basis points of easing priced in for the year.

In the US, strong economic data and pushback from central bankers have prompted traders to adjust expectations for Fed rate cuts.

Markets are currently pricing in a 49pc chance of a US rate cut in March, the CME FedWatch tool showed, compared with an 86pc chance at the end of December.

Meanwhile, traders think there is about a 42pc chance the Bank of England will cut interest rates in May.

Air Astana aims for £757m valuation in London float

Kazakhstan’s national carrier, Air Astana, has said it is set for a stock market valuation of up to $962m (£757m) when it floats in London next month.

The central Asian airline, which is nearly 50pc owned by British defence giant BAE Systems, has set the indicative price range for its dual listing in London and Kazakhstan at between $2.13 (£1.68) and $2.75 (£2.16) per share.

This would value the group at between $770m (£606m) and $962m (£757m). The final price is expected to be announced around February 9, according to the company.

Its listing would provide a welcome boost to the London initial public offering (IPO) market amid a dearth of City deals and flotations.

Air Astana is 49pc owned by BAE Systems, with the remainder owned by the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund.

BAE is expected to cut its stake as part of the float, netting the FTSE 100 stalwart a windfall, depending on how much of its holding it sells.

The carrier expects to raise around $120m (£94.5m) from the float.

Profit warnings exceed financial crisis peak as economy reels from higher rates

The number of listed companies warning about their profits has surged to its highest level since before the financial crisis as economic stagnation takes its toll on corporate Britain.

Nearly a fifth of public UK-listed companies issued profit warnings in 2023, higher than the 17.7pc reached at the peak of the crisis in 2008.

A total of 294 warnings were issued over the year, according to a report from audit firm EY.

Higher interest rates and rising costs increasingly became an issue for companies throughout 2023, with 38pc of warnings citing one of these as the main reason for the scare.

Smaller companies, which are more vulnerable to demand and profit margin pressures, dominated warnings at the start of 2023. However, by the fourth quarter a third of the companies issuing warnings had annual revenues of over £1bn in a sign of how widespread pressures had become.

Jo Robinson, a partner at EY, said:

Pervasive uncertainty in 2023 created major challenges for businesses around earnings and forecasting, and this is reflected in the number of profit warnings issued last year.

While pressure around costs eased somewhat toward the year-end, the uptick in warnings caused by delays to business decisions and weak consumer confidence indicates an ongoing reluctance to commit to discretionary spending.

Evergrande to liquidate as China property crisis deepens

A Hong Kong court today ordered the liquidation of China’s property giant Evergrande, but the company said it would continue to operate in a case that has become a symbol of the nation’s deepening economic woes.

Once China’s biggest real estate giant, its astronomical debt of more than $300bn (£236bn) had become emblematic of a years-long crisis in the country’s property market that had reverberated throughout the world’s second-largest economy.

The order kickstarts a long process that should see Evergrande’s offshore assets liquidated and its management replaced, after the company failed to develop a working restructuring plan.

The company’s executive director vowed the Hong Kong court’s decision would not impact its operations domestically, while analysts said the ruling would further erode foreign investor confidence in China.

High Court judge Linda Chan said: “(Given) the obvious lack of the progress on the part of the company in putting forward a viable restructuring proposal and the insolvency of the company... I consider that it is appropriate for the court to make a winding up order against the company and I so order.” A housing complex by property development giant Evergrande in Nanjing, in China's eastern Jiangsu province - STR/AFP via Getty Images

The FTSE 100 hovered near a two-week high as energy stocks rose on the back of escalating tensions in the Middle East.

The UK’s flagship stock index edged 0.2pc higher, holding near its strongest level since January 12, as shares of oil majors BP and Shell rose as much as 2.2pc and 1.7pc respectively.

Crude prices climbed after the drone attack on US forces in Jordan added to worries over supply disruption in the Middle East as Houthi rebels stepped up their attacks on vessels in the Red Sea.

Both the indexes notched their first weekly gain of the year on Friday, aided by upbeat company results as well as hopes of more stimulus for China’s economy.

Investors are awaiting interest rate decisions from the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England later this week, where policymakers are widely expected to hold interest rates steady.

Superdry examines 'cost saving options' amid restructure speculation

Troubled fashion brand Superdry has said it is looking at “various material cost saving options” after reports the company is considering a major restructuring which could include store closures and job cuts.

Such a move could result in store closures and potentially force through rent reductions with landlords.

Today, Superdry told the stock market:

In line with the company’s turnaround strategy, the company confirms it is working with advisers to explore the feasibility of various material cost saving options.

Whilst there is no certainty that any of these options are progressed, they aim to build on the success of the cost saving initiatives carried out by the company to date and position the business for long-term success.

Iceland boss backs Labour after quitting Tories

The executive chairman of Iceland supermarket has given his backing to Labour, saying the party was the “right choice” for business and voters.

Richard Walker, the executive chairman of the supermarket and a former Tory donor, quit the Conservative party last October in a blow to Rishi Sunak.

Philips cuts losses after sleep apnoea product recall

Under-fire medical device maker Philips said it would halt new sales in the US of its machines designed to help treat sleep apnoea after a series of product recalls that have continued to impact its results.

The Dutch company trimmed its losses for 2023 compared with the previous year, as it seeks to bounce back from what it had described as a “very difficult” 2022.

Philips posted losses of €463m (£395m) over the full year, compared with €1.6bn (£1.4bn) in 2022, with chief executive Roy Jakobs hailing “strong results”.

He said: “While there is more work to be done, the progress we achieved in a volatile world lays a solid foundation for sustained performance.”

Since 2021, the company has been battling a series of crises over its DreamStation machines for sleep apnoea, a disorder in which breathing stops and starts during sleep.

Mr Jakobs said: “Resolving the consequences of the Respironics recall for our patients and customers is a key focus area and I acknowledge and apologise for the distress and concern caused.” Philips' headquarters is in Amsterdam - LEX VAN LIESHOUT/AFP/Getty Images

Ryanair deliver vote of confidence in Boeing planes

Ryanair has told Boeing that if any US customers refuse to take delivery of 737 MAX 10 aircraft, that it would buy them “at the right price”.

The Irish airline, Europe’s largest by passenger numbers, already has 150 firm orders for the MAX 10, the largest jet in the 737 family, and options for 150 more, with the first deliveries due in 2027.

It said it expects the jet to be certified by the end of the year and flying early next year despite the Federal Aviation Administration’s now-lifted grounding of MAX 9 jets following the mid-air blowout of a cabin panel on a new Alaska Airlines plane.

United Airlines boss Scott Kirby, whose carrier has ordered 277 MAX 10 jets with options for another 200, said last week his airline would build a new fleet plan that does not include the model, which had already been mired in regulatory and delivery delays before the Alaska Airlines incident.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary said: “We have told them if some of these American airlines don’t want to take the MAX 10 aircraft, Ryanair will take those aircraft.”

He described the MAX 10 as “transformational” and said Boeing would always make great aircraft “but quality does need to be improved.”

Referring to the United Airlines boss, Ryanair chief financial officer Neil Sorahan said: “If Scott Kirby doesn’t want to take his MAX 10s, then we’ll very happily take them at the right price.” Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he would buy Boeing MAX 10 aircraft - REUTERS/Nadja Wohlleben

Ryanair blames £1bn fuel costs for profit blow

Ryanair said its net profit dived 93pc in its third quarter as higher fuel costs offset rising revenues, resulting in a lower full-year earnings forecast.

The carrier, which flies mostly throughout Europe, said net profit slumped to €14.8m (£12.6m) in the final three months of 2023 compared with one year earlier.

The low-cost airline said traffic grew 7pc to 41.4m during the period but its fuel bill rose by €320m (£273m), or 35pc, to €1.2bn (£1bn).

Chief executive Michael O’Leary said Ryanair was narrowing its forecast for annual net profit to a range of €1.85bn and €1.95bn. It previously estimated between €1.85bn and €2.05bn. Ryanair took a 93pc hit to its profit after tax - REUTERS/Tony Gentile

Good morning

Thanks for joining us. Home sellers are being forced to slash their asking prices by 10pc or more as the market stagnates in the wake of surging interest rates.

A fifth of sellers are cutting prices by a tenth or greater, according to the property website Zoopla.

In London and the South East, the proportion of sellers accepting a discount on this scale rises to almost one in four.

The housing market has struggled in the wake of the cost of living crisis, which has forced the Bank of England to increase interest rates to a 16-year high. Mortgage costs have surged as a result.

However, Zoopla did find some reasons for optimism. Buyer demand has risen 12pc with the biggest increase in London, of 21pc.

Agreed sales have also increased across the country, up 13pc compared to the same time last year with sales rising in all regions.

This indicates buyers and sellers are more aligned on pricing, according to Zoopla.

Richard Donnell, executive director at Zoopla, said: “This improvement in activity will support sales volumes which, at one million, reached an eleven year low in 2023.”

Employers wanted to give workers access to resources and expect quick results. Content consumers did not want to miss a single second because of the quality of the connection. This demand for high-quality Internet services became the driving force behind the development of the 5G communications segment.

The construction of fifth-generation mobile networks requires significant financial investments and promises equally high returns. Therefore, it is worth taking a closer look at 5G technology stocks that are ready to bring sustainable profits to their owners.

Qorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is involved in high-tech products ranging from IoT and defense to automobiles and smartphones. It specializes in microchips used in various devices. The company’s interests include the development of 5G technologies. It is predicted that about half of all Android smartphones will be able to use 5G by the end of 2024. That is why a significant growth of attention to Qorvo and QRVO shares is expected.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

Fifty of the company’s facilities in North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe continue to provide consumers with modern products. As a result of the tremendous work, sales in Q2 FY 2024 approached $1.1 billion. Almost half of this amount was accounted for by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). And deliveries to these companies are only growing.

After October 2023, QRVO demonstrated its capacity to grow rapidly as one of the promising 5G technology stocks. An analysis of the company’s intrinsic value shows a value of roughly $162, indicating a great time to enter.

In the next two years, the company plans to increase cash flow and grow its revenue by 49%. If the company’s expenses remain under control, investors may find themselves in a significant gain, taking advantage of the current undervaluation of the asset.

With a market capitalization of roughly $10 billion and exceeding analysts’ expectations for earnings per share, Qorvo is a highly promising investment target. The stock’s one-year low and high are $80.62 and $114.97, respectively. Analysts have been revising QRVO upward in the last three months. Given that Qorvo has exceeded earnings expectations for 20 consecutive quarters, investors can feel more confident about having shares of this company in their portfolio.

5G and broadband are key focus areas for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The company’s performance over the past few months shows how right it is. 400,000 new subscriptions in Q3 2023 and the success of myPlan helped to strengthen Verizon’s position.

It’s worth looking at the company’s Q4 2023 results. According to this data, total revenue reached $35.1 billion, which is similar to the last quarter of 2022. Operating income growth is observed in both the business and consumer segments. In both cases, the growth rate is close to 3%. Sales of wireless services proved to be a significant source of revenue for the company, growing to $19.4 billion.

The growth of the customer base demonstrates the company’s advantages over other providers in the industry and is consistent with the marketing campaign. This is evidenced by the 16.9% increase in postpaid phone top-ups — the best result in the last four years. That is, Verizon is able not only to retain its current customers but also to lure customers from competitors.

The company’s shares did not stay away from such improvements and gained in value. From October’s $30, VZ experienced a surge, rising above $42, making it an enticing option among 5G technology stocks. Verizon can attract investors not only because of the company’s performance but also because of its competitive dividend. The dividend yield is about 6.35%, which is above the market average and attracts income-oriented investors to VZ.

With 21.6 million prepaid users and 96.3 million customers, T-Mobile US (TMUS) is the largest wireless operator in the United States. Keeping pace with the times, the company focuses on 5G to maintain its market position. Its 5G network is the largest and fastest in the country.

Comparing the 3rd quarter of 2023 and 2022, the company made a breakthrough in terms of net profit, marking an unprecedented 322% growth, positioning T-Mobile US as a standout among 5G technology stocks. In one quarter, T-Mobile managed to earn $2.1 billion, with the stocks’ performance being the best indicator of the company’s success. T-Mobile showed a profit of $1.82 per share, surprising even experts who predicted lower profitability.

In fiscal 2024 EBITDA is expected to grow 9%, which is a significant achievement in the field of 5G technology stocks. But analysts expect that the rate could be higher for several reasons. These include the expected buyout of a large volume of TMUS and the results of deals with Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank (OTCMKTS:SFTBY).

The 2020 acquisition of Sprint expanded the company’s 5G spectrum. This gave it an advantage over other market participants and increased the number of ways T-Mobile could make money, which couldn’t but influence customer growth. The company predicts that the number of 5G fixed broadband subscribers will increase to 7-8 million by 2025.

iPhone Revenues to Benefit From New Models

Apple’s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.9% of net sales in the last reported quarter, wherein sales decreased 0.7% year over year to $43.805 billion.

Apple expects iPhone’s year-over-year revenues to grow on an absolute basis. Our model estimates for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales are pegged at $66.68 billion, up 1.4% year over year.

Apple is expected to have shipped roughly 72.3 million iPhones in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, per our model.

Per the latest Canalys report on worldwide smartphone shipments, Apple’s market share was 24% in the fourth quarter of calendar 2023, beating Samsung’s 17%, driven by new iPhone launches - iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max.

However, iPhone sales are expected to have suffered from weak demand in the Chinese market due to lower demand amid stiff competition from Huawei and a ban on usage by government officials.

Services Growth to Accelerate in Q1

For the fiscal first quarter, Apple expects average revenues per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter.

In the fiscal fourth quarter, Services revenues grew 16.3% from the year-ago quarter to $22.31 billion and accounted for 24.9% of sales.

An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices.

Apple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. App Store continues to grab the attention of prominent developers from around the world, helping the company to offer exciting new apps that drive traffic.

Services like Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle are expected to have contributed to overall growth.

Apple TV+ has been gaining recognition due to its strong content. Apple’s impressive run at the award shows has been instrumental in driving recognition of Apple TV+ in the saturated streaming market currently dominated by the likes of Amazon AMZN Prime Video, Netflix NFLX and Disney’s DIS Disney+.

Consumption of Apple TV+ doubled in 2023, per a report from Deadline cited by 9TO5 Mac. Total viewership surged 42% year over year.

Movies and shows like The Family Plan, The Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, Messi Meets America, Slow Horses, For All Mankind, Silo, Hijack, Bad Sisters and Ted Lasso drove consumption.

However, higher viewership has not essentially turned into a market share leadership for Apple TV+. According to 9TO5Mac, which cited a JustWatch report, Amazon Prime Video was #1 in terms of market share (22%) in the United States, trailed by Netflix (21%). Max, Disney+ and Hulu had 15%,12% and 11% market share, respectively. Apple TV+’s market share increased from 6% to 7%.

Our estimate for fiscal first-quarter Services net sales is pegged at $22.65 billion, indicating 9.1% year-over-year growth.

2024-01-29T16:04:44+00:00,One chart shows why Big Tech earnings are critical for the health of the market rally,"The stock market is still all about tech.

New data from FactSet shows that while strategists have called for a broadening out of the market rally, big tech companies are expected to be the drivers of Q4 earnings growth in the S&P 500.

Earnings for Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are expected to grow a combined 53.7% in the fourth quarter. The other 494 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to see a 10.5% decline.

Five of those companies —Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta — are set to report quarterly results this week.

After the remaining Magnificent Seven tech stock, Tesla (TSLA), disappointed with its report, Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as ""critical for overall market direction.""

The expectations for some names are massive. Nvidia is expected to grow earnings per share by more than 400% compared to the same period a year prior. Analysts project Meta's earnings per share to grow 175% from the same period a year prior.

The eye-popping growth for some of the largest stocks in the market is expected to continue next quarter, too. A second chart from FactSet shows that Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are expected to grow earnings by nearly 80% in the first quarter of 2024. The other 496 companies, including Apple Microsoft and Tesla, are expected to grow earnings by a combined 0.3%.

""Their earnings are incredible compared to the rest of the market,"" JJ Kinahan, IG North America's CEO told Yahoo Finance Live. ""You don't often see this where a few stocks are so outperforming the rest of the market.""

To some on Wall Street, these massive earnings expectations help explain why the S&P 500 is hitting all-time highs and still might not be overvalued.

""There's more growth in that [S&P 500] valuation now than there used to be,"" Pettit said, nodding to the increased position of technology in the index.

Story continues

During the market's recent rally, nearly 90% of the growth seen in January has also been driven by the same tech companies excluding Tesla, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. This comes after the seven tech companies were the major market driver in 2023, and it creates a simple reason for why investors will be watching these reports closely.

Still tech earnings expectations go beyond just the quarterly numbers. It's about updates on various market-moving narratives during earnings calls, too.

Artificial intelligence has been at the center of earnings improvements for Meta and Nvidia. Microsoft and Amazon both have AI plays, too, but their cloud revenues are typically more closely scrutinized. Additionally, Apple's products business can provide a lens into demand for hardware and the overall state of consumer spending.

All of this combines to make tech earnings crucial for the market — not only because people expect Big Tech to do well but because if their results miss estimates, the lagging parts of their business could be a flashing a warning sign about an economic slowdown.

2024-01-29T15:17:58+00:00,RIVN Stock Alert: Rivian Nabs Second Apple Exec,"Rivian Automotive‘s (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock is benefitting from delays in the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Car.

D.J. Novotney, still listed on LinkedIn as vice president-engineering at Apple, will become senior vice president of vehicle programs at Rivian, reporting to CEO RJ Scaringe.

Rivian stock is up 4% in early trading this morning after rising 1% over the weekend. Its market capitalization is about $14.5 billion.

InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips

No Apple Car?

In a memo released as he left, Novotney said, “Apple has been my life.” He worked on a variety of products at the company, including the iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Watch.

Novotney is the second Apple Car executive this month to leave for Rivian, a start-up with ties to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Earlier, Jonas Reinke, who had been with Apple for four years, joined Rivian as vice president of product management. Reinke will now work on Rivian’s in-car software. Rivian bought a Swedish route-planning company, Iternio, last year.

The executive moves may say more about Apple than Rivian. The Apple Car was originally expected to be released this year. Then, it was 2026. Now, that date has recently been moved back to 2028.

Apple is the second Cloud Czar to move away from the auto sector. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) went through three layoffs at its Waymo division last year.

The movement toward self-driving cars has taken numerous hits lately. Accidents have led to General Motors’ (NYSE:GM) Cruise unit being investigated by several federal agencies.

Rivian is best known for its high-end R1T truck and 100,000-unit Amazon delivery van contract. Scaringe said last week he is trying to expand the product line. The company is focusing that effort on a Georgia factory that is due for completion in 2026.

RIVN Stock: What Happens Next?

Drivers should keep both hands on the wheel. Investors might want to keep both hands in their pockets as the electric vehicle (EV) shakeout continues. When you’re shedding Cloud Czars from a market, hard times are ahead.

This week starts slow, but we’ll end it with a full-fledged Jobs Week for February. Tuesday ushers in new JOLTS data for December, Wednesday brings us private-sector ADP ADP payroll totals for this month (along with the latest Fed decision on interest rates), and Friday is the big non-farm payroll survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). All of the forecast numbers are expected to tick down in the labor market, aside from the Unemployment Rate, which is expected to lift back up slightly to 3.8%.

In addition, our new week also features several marquee names of the Tech industry reporting earnings: Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL on Tuesday, Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN on Thursday — all after the closing bell, as per normal. These major firms are all expecting growth on both top and bottom lines, year over year, led by anticipated earnings growth of +285% from Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Amazon, and +15% revenues growth year over year from Zacks Rank #2-rated Microsoft. (In other news, Amazon is no longer pursuing the acquisition for iRobot, citing antitrust issues, sending the smaller stock down -20% at this hour.)

Elsewhere, there will be a bevy of other reports hitting the tape this week, from Case-Shiller home prices to Consumer Confidence to Q4 Productivity to S&P and ISM Manufacturing. We also look for fresh Q4 earnings reports from across the spectrum of sectors, from AMD AMD to General Motors GM to Mondelez MDLZ to Pfizer PFE to Snapchat SNAP and Starbucks SBUX — and that’s just tomorrow!

Off near-term lows on January 18th, three of the four major stock market indices have rebounded into positive territory year-to-date. Only the Russell 2000 is still -3% from the start of this year’s trading, though that’s up from -6% on January 18th. The small-cap index, heavy in regional bank representation, needs three relatively strong trading days to finish the month in the green, along with the others which are already there.

We do not expect Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision to be any factor at all on trading behavior this week. Even among those analysts who still believe — or wish for — six interest rate cuts between now and the end of the year do not foresee one coming this early. Most of these folks look toward early March for the first cut, though this would likely take much weaker numbers in the economy before the Fed would risk loosening the monetary screws.

Video Transcript

- And tech is on deck this week. Some of the stock market's largest technology companies set to report earnings. And for more on how the reports may impact markets, we've got Yahoo Finance's very own Josh Schafer to help us give the rundown for the week ahead.

JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, Brad. So you take a look at that list we just showed five of the so-called Magnificent Seven. And when you think about Tesla's performance a week ago, maybe we're talking more of a Super Six here and not a Magnificent Seven. So really, you're only missing NVIDIA in terms of massive tech companies to report this week.

And really, guys, I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market and the fundamental story that we're seeing in the stock market. So when you take a look at the earnings projections for the six companies-- I'm going to say six here because we're including NVIDIA in the graphic that we're showing, but they're projected to grow earnings-- this is data from FactSet-- at nearly 54% year over year for the fourth quarter.

Look at the other 494 companies. They're expected to have earnings fall 10.5%. So when you think about why stocks move higher and what people are buying, you're buying earnings, right? You want earnings to eventually go up. That is the story of the stock market in the long term. And that's why the short-term story of the stock market has really just been these six stocks. This is what we're waiting for. This is what we-- this is the big moment.

Story continues

- This is what we're waiting for. It's a big moment. And then you pair that also with the jobs data that we're going to be getting out on Friday, the Fed decision on Wednesday. I know you closely are following that as well, Josh.

In terms of investors' view on this, in terms of the big driver of the market or the key thing that traders are going to be listening for obviously a lot of that's going to be surrounding the timing of that first cut. But beyond that, what do you think has the potential to move the markets this week?

JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. I mean, it seems like overall, we're still in the soft landing is probably consensus and probably to the upside, right, as far as what people are expecting. So anything that doesn't give us that, when you're thinking maybe a really cool jobs report, perhaps the Fed talking about cutting later than people think or being more restrictive than people think, or I do think the fundamental earnings story from tech because of where the overall S&P is at right now.

I did a story over the weekend about the S&P being potentially overvalued and what strategists say about that. Well, they talk about if you really think about what's in the S&P, you're buying future earnings growth, right? And if you get that earnings growth from these big companies, then one could argue the S&P 500 at a record high isn't overvalued, and it has room to keep growing.

So you get all three aspects this week, right? We talk about the Fed a lot. That can move your major indexes and move things. We talked about the Mag Seven. We're getting that. And we've got a jobs report on Friday because why not?

- So I guess we'll talk on Friday, and we'll decide what the biggest mover was of the week.

- Certainly setting up to be a very busy week here potentially for the markets. Josh, great stuff. Thanks so much.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/big-tech-earnings-markets-expecting-142946351.html,"['0QZI.LSE', '0R1O.IL', '0RIH.LSE', 'AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'ABEA.F', 'ABEA.STU', 'ABEA.XETRA', 'ABEC.F', 'ABEC.XETRA', 'AMZ.F', 'AMZ.XETRA', 'AMZN.MI', 'AMZN.MX', 'AMZN.US', 'AMZO34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA', 'FB2A.F']",[],"{'polarity': 0.991, 'neg': 0.015, 'neu': 0.912, 'pos': 0.073}"
2024-01-29T14:16:11+00:00,Seeking Clues to Apple (AAPL) Q1 Earnings? A Peek Into Wall Street Projections for Key Metrics,"In its upcoming report, Apple (AAPL) is predicted by Wall Street analysts to post quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share, reflecting an increase of 11.2% compared to the same period last year. Revenues are forecasted to be $117.62 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 0.4%.

Over the last 30 days, there has been a downward revision of 0.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter, leading to its current level. This signifies the covering analysts' collective reconsideration of their initial forecasts over the course of this timeframe.

Prior to a company's earnings announcement, it is crucial to consider revisions to earnings estimates. This serves as a significant indicator for predicting potential investor actions regarding the stock. Empirical research has consistently demonstrated a robust correlation between trends in earnings estimate revision and the short-term price performance of a stock.

While investors typically use consensus earnings and revenue estimates as a yardstick to evaluate the company's quarterly performance, scrutinizing analysts' projections for some of the company's key metrics can offer a more comprehensive perspective.

With that in mind, let's delve into the average projections of some Apple metrics that are commonly tracked and projected by analysts on Wall Street.

Analysts expect 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' to come in at $11.27 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -16.4%.

The consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPhone' will reach $68.64 billion. The estimate points to a change of +4.4% from the year-ago quarter.

The average prediction of analysts places 'Net Sales- Services' at $23.40 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +12.7%.

Analysts forecast 'Revenue- Mac' to reach $7.77 billion. The estimate points to a change of +0.4% from the year-ago quarter.

Analysts predict that the 'Net Sales- Products' will reach $94.45 billion. The estimate points to a change of -2% from the year-ago quarter.

Story continues

Analysts' assessment points toward 'Revenue- iPad' reaching $6.77 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -28% from the prior-year quarter.

The consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' stands at $23.32 billion. The estimate points to a change of -2.5% from the year-ago quarter.

The collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' of $28.66 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +3.5% from the prior-year quarter.

It is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.28 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -2.7%.

Based on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' should arrive at $7.15 billion. The estimate suggests a change of +5.8% year over year.

According to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' should come in at $49.83 billion. The estimate points to a change of +1.1% from the year-ago quarter.

The combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Gross margin- Services' will likely reach $16.79 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $14.71 billion in the same quarter last year.

2024-01-29T13:45:00+00:00,Chinese AR Glasses Maker Raises $60 Million to Compete With Apple,"(Bloomberg) -- Augmented reality glasses maker Xreal is raising fresh funding at a valuation that tops $1 billion, according to Chief Executive Officer Chi Xu, aiming to get out ahead of future devices from Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.

Traders Line Up for ‘Once-in-a-Generation’ Emerging Markets Bet Musk Says First Neuralink Patient Received Implant in Brain Blackstone Is Building a $25 Billion Empire of Power-Hungry Data Centers Trump Cash Stockpile at Risk From $450 Million Dual Verdicts Amazon Drops iRobot Deal; Roomba Maker Cuts 31% of Staff

The Chinese startup is raising $60 million in the round, bringing its total to more than $300 million, Chi said in an interview. That latest money comes from a key supply chain partner that he declined to identify.

“This will help us scale our manufacturing capabilities and research and development,” he said, adding that the company has enough capacity to meet demand for its glasses this year but needs the money to fulfill orders in 2025.

Xreal is looking to blaze a trail in augmented reality — technology that overlays data and imagery over real-world views. The company accounted for about half of the market for AR-only devices in the third quarter of last year, according to research firm IDC. The larger combined virtual reality and AR market — known as mixed reality — features Meta as the leader, followed by Sony Group Corp. and ByteDance Ltd. Xreal holds about 4% of the overall market.

Chi said that his company has the ability to produce between 500,000 and 1 million units this year. The investment should allow for production of 2 million devices next year. The company expects to generate $100 million to $150 million in revenue this year and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025, according to Chi, who said he wants Xreal to go public in the US within two years.

The 7-year-old business now has about 600 employees and is based in Beijing. The company’s Air glasses present notifications, games and video in a wearer’s field of view. Chi said that Xreal’s products have made gains on more costly technology from Magic Leap Inc. and Microsoft Corp., which sells a headset called the HoloLens.

“2023 was a very good year, and the market size pretty much doubled,” Chi said. The company, which said it gets the majority of its sales from Amazon.com Inc.’s website, offers AR glasses for as little as a few hundred dollars. But it believes its latest pair — the Air 2 Ultra — is what will drive future revenue.

“There’s a good chance we can do 50,000 units of Ultra this year,” Chi said, adding that the cheaper models are “definitely easier to sell” and that mass consumers aren’t seeking as many bells and whistles as what they might get on rival products.

Xreal doesn’t have plans to get into virtual reality — a more immersive technology that’s used in Apple’s new Vision Pro — but Chi believes his company will compete with the iPhone maker in the years to come.

“I think we’re three to five years ahead of them in AR,” Chi said. “They are catching up, though. So we need to keep up and push the boundary.”

During development of the Vision Pro, Apple also worked on lightweight AR-only glasses similar to what Xreal offers. The company paused work on that device because it didn’t think the technology was ready yet, Bloomberg News reported last year. Meta and Google have said they’re planning their own consumer AR glasses for release in the coming years.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Most Undervalued Quality Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.

More and more investors turned to quality in 2023 as interest rates went higher amid the inflation storm. The iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF gained 29% in 2023, beating the S&P 500 returns of 24%. The rise of Magnificent Seven stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was a sign of the market's concentration in quality as investors flocked to companies with strong balance sheets and fundamentals. But what exactly are quality stocks? Billionaire Cliff Asness, Andrea Frazzini, and Lasse H. Pedersen wrote a research paper in 2013 titled ""Quality Minus Junk"" in which they defined quality stocks as follows:

""We define a quality security as one that has characteristics that, all-else-equal, an investor should be willing to pay a higher price for: stocks that are safe, profitable, growing, and well managed. High quality stocks do have higher prices on average, but not by a very large margin. Perhaps because of this puzzlingly modest impact of quality on price, high-quality stocks have high risk-adjusted returns. Indeed, a quality-minus-junk (QMJ) factor that goes long high-quality stocks and shorts low-quality stocks earns significant risk-adjusted returns in the U.S. and globally across 24 countries. The price of quality – i.e., how much investors pay extra for higher quality stocks – varies over time, reaching a low during the internet bubble.""

While the market is expecting rate cuts this year, rising geopolitical tensions and a persistent inflation is keeping the demand for quality stocks higher. Almost all notable investment firms including Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs recommended investors to buy high quality names for 2024. Why?  High-quality stocks tend to perform better when growth is slowing down. A latest Wall Street Journal report quoted data from UBS which said the MSCI ACWI Quality Index has beaten the MSCI’s global index by 1 percentage point over six-month periods in which the economic growth slowed.

Story continues

The research paper from Cliff Asness we mentioned earlier also talked about the returns of quality stocks during troubled times:

""Our results present a puzzle for asset pricing. They are consistent with quality stocks being underpriced and junk stocks overpriced or, alternatively, with quality stocks being riskier than junk stocks. However, while one can never rule out a risk explanation for the high return of quality stocks, we are unable to identify this risk; in anything, we find evidence of the opposite. We show that quality stocks are low beta and, rather than exhibiting crash risk, if anything they benefit from “flight to quality,” that is, they have a tendency to perform well during periods of extreme market distress. These findings present a challenge for risk-based explanations where bad states of the world are negatively correlated to extreme return realizations of the market factor. Finally, we show that the price of quality varies over time, generating a time-varying expected return on quality-minus-junk portfolios: a low price of quality predicts a high future return of quality stocks relative to junk stocks.""

Methodology

For this article we first listed down all holdings of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF with PE ratios less than 30 as of January 26. From these stocks we picked 16 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why hedge funds? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

16. Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 23

Transportation services company Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. In October Landstar System Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) posted Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $1.71, beating estimates by $0.01.

15. American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42

With a dividend yield of 2% and a PE ratio of 13, insurance and financial solutions company American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) is among the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge funds shows that 42 hedge funds had stakes in American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG).

Diamond Hill Large Cap Strategy made the following comment about American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Insurance company American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) was also among our top contributors. The company’s most recent operating results outperformed expectations, as it reported robust earnings with improving underwriting margins in the property and casualty business. AIG’s strategic initiatives also added to the positive sentiment. The company made further progress in separating its Life & Retirement unit by selling additional shares via a secondary offering. Furthermore, AIG announced the sale of its reinsurance business to RenaissanceRe at an attractive valuation, a move that will further reduce volatility in AIG’s continuing operations.”

14. Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 42

Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) is one of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

Earlier this month, Wolfe Research upgraded Microchip Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MCHP) along with some other semiconductor stocks as it becomes ""incrementally more bullish"" on analog circuits.

""We stayed neutral on analog for too long this cycle, since stocks bottomed an unprecedented full year before fundamentals began to deteriorate,"" Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso said in a note.

Here is what Weitz Conservative Allocation Fund has to say about Microchip Technology Incorporated (NASDAQ:MCHP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“We added a new position in Microchip Technology, Inc., (NASDAQ:MCHP) to the Fund during the quarter. Microchip is a leading provider of mixed signal microcontrollers and analog semiconductors to a broad range of industrial, data center, automotive, communication and consumer appliance customers. The company enjoys favorable product characteristics that help drive strong profitability, and it benefits from several long-wave demand tailwinds such as electronification, automation, and growth in data communications. While Microchip is not immune from semiconductor cycles, its cash flows have been durable through cycles. The multi-year outlook is solid, and we think the company is poised to further boost per-share value growth through increasing share repurchases at discounted prices.

13. Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 44

HR and payroll solutions company Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) ranks 13th in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to smart money investors. Earlier this month Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) declared a $0.89 per share dividend, in line with the previous dividend. Paychex Inc.'s (NASDAQ:PAYX) board also approved to buy back up to $400 million of its common stock beginning February 1, 2024 and expiring on May 31, 2027.

Ensemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:

“Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) (3.71% weight in the Fund): While employment growth was strong in 2023, the Fed’s efforts to moderate job growth was successful. Paychex business is driven by the number of employees on the payrolls of its small to medium size business customers. With recession worries percolating all year, the stock was flat on a year to date basis in late October just as the economic outlook began to brighten. As recession worries faded the stock rallied to gains of as much as 13% in the fourth quarter. But in the late December earnings report, the company said that core payroll services growth would be a bit weaker than investors expected. Despite this, the company slightly raised full year earnings guidance as demand for their full service solution that incorporates human resources services beyond payroll improved. The stock finished the quarter up 4.1%.”

12. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 48

In December, Morgan Stanley published a list of 32 stocks with high free cash flow, high earnings per share growth, and an overweight rating in its U.S. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) made it to the list.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 48 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC) during this period was Paul Singer's Elliott Management which owns a $1.7 billion stake in Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC).

11. Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 53

Oppenheimer recently started covering Builders FirstSource with an Outperform rating. Here is what the firm said about Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):

“The company has a market-leading position in a fragmented industry and should benefit from our optimistic view of single-family housing starts in 2024. Growth in value-added products increases the amount of revenue tied to services and is a positive for gross margin and returns.”

Over the past one year Builders FirstSource Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) shares have gained about 124%.

In its Q3 2023 investor letter, Bonhoeffer Capital Management stated the following regarding Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR):

“Over the past 12 months, interest rates have been increasing, which has reduced the economics of this strategy; but a large spread still exists if assets can be purchased at the right price. Increasing interest rates has affected the returns on public LBO firms. Some firms, like Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NYSE:BLDR) (described below), have reacted to higher interest rates by moderating their use of debt in their expansion plans.

Builders FirstSource, a portfolio holding, is an example of a private LBO. Given BLDR’s current valuation of an 11% earnings yield and, more importantly, a five-year forward earnings yield of 15%, buybacks are accretive. The net income annual growth is expected to be between 17-20% over the next four years based upon management’s guidance. This net income growth would imply a 17-20% total return before changes to the current modest valuation of 9x earnings. Below is the history of BLDR’s RoIC and RoIIC…” (Click here to read the full text)

10. Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 55

With a dividend yield of 3.7% and a low PE ratio, Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) is a notable member of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF portfolio. The stock is up about 3.9% over the past six months.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 55 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) was Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management which owns a $358 million stake in Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD).

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Dividend Strategy stated the following regarding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD):

“In the second half of 2023 — as we were selling low-growth, high-multiple stocks and taking advantage of oversold conditions in infrastructure, real estate and utilities — we also found opportunities in overlooked areas of health care. After adding Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) in the third quarter, we bought AstraZeneca in the fourth quarter. Each of these stocks present distinct investment cases, but both are reasonably valued and have limited patent expiry or pipeline risk. Gilead’s strength comes from its dominant franchise in HIV. It offers lower growth, but it yields nearly 4% and trades at 11x earnings. AstraZeneca possesses a diversified portfolio of pharmaceuticals, which should deliver double-digit earnings growth, yet it trades at just 16x earnings. These stocks were underwritten individually, but collectively we like the idea of increasing our exposure to defensive and growing health care names at below-market multiples.”

9. Target Corp (NYSE:TGT)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 58

US retailer Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is a key part of the Vanguard U.S. Quality Factor ETF. The stock has a dividend yield of over 3% and had 58 hedge fund investors as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.

Target Corp (NYSE:TGT) is also among the stocks Morgan Stanley is recommending for 2024.

Like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), hedge funds are also buying Target.

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT):

“Other meaningful moves during the quarter included additions to cyclical growers we consider early cycle consumer plays: Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), a position initiated in the third quarter, and Estee Lauder. As earnings start to recover, these stocks and semiconductors tend to be among the first to move. We may be a little early and could see some choppiness in stock prices as job growth and consumer spending cool due to the lagged effects of Fed tightening, but we believe we’re closer to the bottom in terms of economic activity and that both companies, as well as Union Pacific, are well-positioned to benefit as consumer sentiment improves and the economy begins to recover.”

8. Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 64

Piper Sandler recently said in a report that Cisco Systems Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO) shares have ""reversed"" a downtrend and the investment firm expects more upside to the stock.

Piper Sandler mentioned this in its Technical Research report on SMID Momentum. Piper Sandler said:

“We are optimistic about equities with the (SPX), (INDU), and (NDX) hitting record highs, but waning market breadth is a notable concern. We saw some signs of rotation yesterday as SMID-caps began rallying out of their three-week pullbacks.”

Oakmark Fund made the following comment about Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”

7. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) ranks seventh in our list of the most undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Bristol-Myers has a dividend yield of about 4.8% and its biggest shareholder as of the end of the third quarter of 2023 was John Overdeck and David Siegel's Two Sigma Advisors which owns a $384 million stake.

Out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 65 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY).

In addition to BMY, hedge funds are also piling into Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Madison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) and The Walt Disney Company. We added Texas Instruments as a new position. Bristol-Myers has been dealing with the loss of exclusivity for Revlimid, one of its key products. Although the company is launching new drugs in melanoma, heart failure, and psoriasis it will need additional products to offset the lower revenue in Revlimid.”

6. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 65

Earlier in January, BofA listed its Efficient Growth Index top members for 2023’s fourth quarter in its RIC Report. PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) was part of the list of stocks mentioned in the report.

With a PE ratio of 27 and a 3% dividend yield, PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) ranks sixth in our list of the best undervalued quality stocks to buy according to hedge funds. Insider Monkey's proprietary database of 910 funds shows that 65 funds had stakes in PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) as of the end of the September quarter.

RiverPark Advisors made the following comment about PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP): PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and snack food company with a portfolio of brands, including Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. The company, through its operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells a wide variety of beverages and snack foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.

PEP, through acquisitions, marketing, and product innovation has reinvigorated top line expansion and is now expected to grow revenues in the mid-single digit percent rate for the foreseeable future. We expect this revenue growth to drive margin expansion and free cash flow growth from $5.6 billion in 2022 to $12.3 billion in 2028. Based on this more than doubling of free cash flow and the company’s 2.8% dividend yield, we believe we can achieve double digit rates of return from the stock regardless of the economic environment ahead. We initiated a small position in August.”

2024-01-29T10:06:00+00:00,3 Warren Buffett Stocks I Wouldn't Touch With a 10-Foot Pole in 2024,"If you've ever wondered why Wall Street continually sings the praises of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett, look no further than his track record as an investor since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s. He's practically doubled up the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 spanning nearly six decades and has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of 4,504,012% as of the closing bell on Jan. 22, 2024.

However, the Oracle of Omaha isn't infallible. Although riding his coattails over multiple decades has been a bona fide moneymaking strategy, there have been some dud investments from him and his investment team along the way.

As we push ahead into 2024, three of the roughly 50 stocks currently held in Berkshire Hathaway's $368 billion investment portfolio are companies I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.

Snowflake

The first Buffett stock I want nothing to do with in the new year is none other than the cloud-based data warehousing companySnowflake(NYSE: SNOW).

Even though I'm not a fan of Snowflake (the reasoning of which I'll get to in a moment), I can appreciate its well-defined competitive advantages. We're still in the relatively early stages of enterprise cloud spending ramping up, which means Snowflake is liable to easily sustain a double-digit growth pace throughout the remainder of the decade.

More importantly, Snowflake's cloud infrastructure is built atop the most popular cloud infrastructure service platforms. Whereas sharing data can be difficult among competing cloud services, Snowflake members can easily do so.

I'll also add that Snowflake's pay-as-you-go model, which shuns subscription fees in favor of charging customers based on the data they store, is clearly encouraging businesses to utilize its services.

The reasons I'm out on Snowflake in 2024 are threefold. First, I expect the U.S. to enter a recession at some point this year. I'm basing this on a couple of money-based metrics that have historically correlated strongly with downturns in the U.S. economy. A recession would be expected to slow spending across the board for tech companies, at least temporarily.

Story continues

Secondly, the Snowflake investment story has long been about its outsize growth rate. Over the past three years, year-over-year product revenue growth has fallen from 102% in fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 31, 2022) to an estimated 35% in fiscal 2024. Mind you, I'm not saying Snowflake's growth story is over. Rather, I'm pointing out that its outsize valuation premium is no longer warranted, especially with sales growth forecast to slide to 30% in fiscal 2025, according to Wall Street's consensus.

The third reason I'm avoiding Snowflake in 2024 is its valuation. It's currently valued at a multiple of 176 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for the coming fiscal year, with a slowing growth rate. While I'm willing to afford Snowflake some level of valuation premium for its competitive advantages, this is excessive.

Kraft Heinz

The second Warren Buffett stock I won't be touching with a 10-foot pole in 2024 is brand-name packaged foods and condiments company Kraft Heinz(NASDAQ: KHC). You'll note that I'm not just picking on growth stocks.

Similar to Snowflake, Kraft Heinz does have a few redeeming qualities. For one, it's a consumer staples stock. This is to say that it provides basic needs goods (i.e., food) that consumers will buy regardless of how well or poorly the U.S. economy performs. Consumer staples stocks are typically known for their market-topping dividend yields and somewhat consistent operating cash flow.

Something else Kraft Heinz brings to the table is its portfolio of well-known brands. In addition to the obvious, Kraft and Heinz, it's behind popular brands like Oscar Mayer, Velveeta, Jell-O, Philadelphia, and Kool-Aid. Brand-name products give Kraft Heinz the confidence to raise its prices and stay ahead of the inflationary curve.

However, these competitive edges for Kraft Heinz are trumped by two big concerns.

To begin with, the company's operating results show a multiquarter decline in volume/mix. This suggests that consumers are becoming more price-sensitive in the wake of historically high inflation and have begun to trade down to cheaper store-branded goods. Although Kraft Heinz has enjoyed exceptional pricing power, a decline in volume/mix implies a challenging growth environment.

The other issue for Kraft Heinz is the company's debt- and goodwill-laden balance sheet. It closed out September with $19.9 billion in long-term debt, compared to $1.05 billion in cash and cash equivalents. While it remains cash-flow positive, there's not a lot of capital left over for Kraft Heinz to reignite interest in its brands.

It's also lugging around $30.3 billion in goodwill, which could be written down in a similar fashion to the $15.4 billion writedown taken in February 2019.

Despite a reasonably low forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 12, Kraft Heinz's balance sheet and stagnant growth make it an easy stock to avoid in the new year. Image source: Apple.

Apple

The third Warren Buffett stock I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole in 2024 is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). It's also the largest holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio -- over 48% of invested assets -- so please don't forward this article to the Oracle of Omaha.

To keep with the theme, Apple brings plenty of sustained operating advantages to the table. It's consistently viewed as the world's most valuable brand and has an exceptionally loyal following of customers. But Apple's biggest advantage is steeped in its innovation.

It's consistently accounted for around half of all U.S. smartphone market share since introducing 5G-capable versions of its iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020. Further, CEO Tim Cook is overseeing the steady transformation of Apple into a platforms company. A subscription-driven operating model should lift the company's operating margin, smooth out revenue fluctuations during major iPhone replacement cycles, and keep consumers loyal to the company's ecosystem of products and services.

I'd be remiss if I didn't mention Apple's market-leading capital-return program as well. It's repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since introducing a share buyback program in 2013. A declining outstanding share count has had a positive impact on the company's earnings per share (EPS).

The problem with Apple and the primary reason I'm not touching this stock in 2024 is that its growth engine has stalled. In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), sales for all its physical product segments (iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Wearables) fell from the prior-year period.

What's even more noteworthy about this decline is that Apple's nearly 3% year-over-year sales slump occurred with inflation well above its historic average. Despite the incredible brand loyalty of its customers, Apple's sales still declined in fiscal 2023.

It's a similar story for Apple's profits. Although EPS crept higher by a penny, thanks to the company's aggressive share repurchase program, net income fell $2.8 billion to $97 billion.

The investment thesis for Apple has always hinged on a brand-name company delivering outsize growth for its size. It's why investors haven't batted an eye when paying 20 or 25 times forward-year earnings for one of the largest publicly traded companies. But without its trademark growth, Apple's forward year P/E of 27 is historically high.

Although Warren Buffett's company has made a veritable fortune investing in Apple, I don't expect 2024 to be a particularly good year for the tech giant.

2024-01-29T09:39:13+00:00,Apple's 'Find My' Feature Helps An iPhone Owner Recover Their Stolen Phone From Walmart's 'EcoATM': Here's How You Can Save Yours,"In a recent incident, an iPhone user managed to recover their stolen device from an EcoATM kiosk at Walmart Inc., thanks to Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""Find My"" app’s location tracking feature.

What Happened: A user posted on Reddit that their iPhone 15 was stolen at their workplace. The thief turned off the device, making it untraceable. Assuming the phone was lost for good, the user settled their old phone’s dues and bought a new one.

The next day, the “Find My” app started displaying the phone’s changing locations. Eventually, the device’s location was traced to a nearby Walmart. The user and a friend went to the store and began looking for the phone.

The stolen iPhone was finally found in Walmart's EcoATM kiosk, which purchases used phones for cash. After contacting the local police, the user retrieved the device from the machine.

Why It Matters: This incident underscores the effectiveness of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) “Find My” app, despite previous reports of it leading iPhone owners on a wild goose chase. In April 2023, multiple iPhone owners were led to a single Texas address due to alleged faulty Maps data.

The utility of the “Find My” feature extends beyond iPhones. In June 2023, Apple announced an iOS 17 update that made it easier to locate a misplaced Apple Watch using the Control Center.

How To Enable ‘Find My' On iPhone

Open the Settings app and tap your name. Tap Find My, and if you want to inform your friends and family about your location, enable Share My Location. Now, tap and enable Find My iPhone.

You can also find your iPhone even when it's offline by enabling ""Find My network.""

Make sure you have enabled Location Services on your iPhone to be able to locate your device on a map.

2024-01-29T08:03:38+00:00,Investors see Microsoft's stock market value leaving Apple behind,"By Noel Randewich

(Reuters) - Microsoft's early lead in artificial intelligence has the software heavyweight's stock market value poised to pull decisively ahead of Apple's over the next five years, 13 institutional investors unanimously agreed ahead of the tech titans' quarterly results this week.

Microsoft's shares have surged 7% so far in 2024, recently sending its stock market value above $3 trillion and dethroning Apple as the world's most valuable company. As of Friday, the Redmond, Washington software maker's market capitalization was a few billion dollars above Apple's. Asked which would be more valuable five years from now, all 13 investments strategists and portfolio managers consulted by Reuters last week said they expect Microsoft to outpace Apple. Share prices and valuations could shift this week as Microsoft reports its quarterly results on Tuesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. In the long term, though, all the investors consulted by Reuters said Microsoft's recent successes in generative AI give it a powerful advantage over Apple.

Still, the race between Apple and Microsoft could turn into a race for second place, some said, citing the huge recent gains by Nvidia, whose chips have powered the AI revolution.Microsoft made early investments in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and is incorporating generative AI technology across its business. AI is likely to benefit Microsoft's cloud-computing offerings as it competes with Amazon and Alphabet in that burgeoning market. In its applications business, Outlook now offers users AI help composing emails.

Microsoft ""has more levers to pull in the forms of Azure cloud, gaming, enterprise software, and of course, AI is the most compelling,"" said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management. ""Apple is most reliant on the iPhone, which is a mature market, and the company has yet to detail how it will compete in the AI arms race.""

Apple has been quietly incorporating AI into product functions, such as snapping better iPhone photos, but investors will want to hear more AI plans when the company reports its December quarter results. They also will be watching China, where demand for iPhones has slumped due to a slow economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and as a resurgent Huawei erodes the Cupertino, California company's market share.

Apple starts sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset in the U.S. on Friday, its most expensive bet in more than a decade. Since Steve Jobs launched the iPhone in 2007, Apple's stock has surged more than 4,300%, helping Apple eclipse Exxon Mobil in 2011 as Wall Street's most valuable company and making it a cornerstone investment of portfolio managers trying to outperform the S&P 500.

With investors worried about soft demand for iPhones in China, Apple's stock is flat so far in 2024, underperforming the S&P 500's nearly 2.5% rise as well as the 7% surge in Microsoft shares this year.

Microsoft's shares also rallied 57% rally in 2023 thanks to its lead in generative AI. Its stock is now trading at 33 times expected earnings, compared a forward PE of 28 for Apple and around 20 for the S&P 500, according to LSEG.

""These are quality growth companies ... but in order to warrant these valuations, they need to continue to grow at aggressive clips. You're going to need increases in productivity, and I think Microsoft is better poised than Apple to do so,"" said Mike Dickson, head of research at Horizon Investments.

Fifty Wall Street analysts recommend buying Microsoft shares, while four analysts have neutral ratings and none recommend selling, according to LSEG data. Apple has 26 positive analyst ratings and 12 neutral ratings, while two analysts recommend selling, including a downgrade to ""underweight"" by Barclays this month due to worries about ""lackluster"" iPhone sales.

Nvidia, now the most valuable chipmaker after its shares more than tripled last year, may also be a contender for the world's most valuable company in the next few years, said Wayne Kaufman, Chief Market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. After hitting record highs last week, Nvidia's market capitalization reached over $1.5 trillion making it Wall Street's fifth most valuable company, less than $200 billion behind Amazon. ""I have told our brokers and clients that Nvidia is like Microsoft in the early 90s and Intel in the early 80s,"" Kaufman said.

2024-01-29T06:00:59+00:00,What AI can't do at work,"AI still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch. (Westend61 via Getty Images)

Artificial intelligence is now a part of our everyday lives and many of us use and encounter AI without even thinking about it. We ask Alexa to play music or check a recipe, Siri organises our calendars and Facebook, Instagram and X use the technology to decide which social media posts — or adverts — to show us.

The development of accessible tools like ChatGPT has also led to the integration of AI in the workplace. AI’s ability to analyse huge amounts of data and recognise patterns allows it to imitate human function and to problem-solve, reason, learn, perceive and carry out day-to-day admin tasks. Understandably, this had led to concerns about its potential to surpass human capacity in certain areas.

AI may be capable of creating images and text, hiring, predicting trends and making financial decisions, but it’s important to remember its limitations. While the tech will undoubtedly bring a whole host of support and capabilities to our workplaces, it is essential to understand that it won’t completely replace humans — at least not yet, anyway.

It still lacks something essential to nearly all jobs — the human touch.

AI can't empathise

“AI has been a great tool to assist with data analysis and automation, but it lacks the genuine empathy and practical common sense in various aspects of work and life,” says careers expert Deirdre Orr. “The ability to understand emotions, navigate complex social dynamics, and make nuanced decisions based on context and experience sets humans apart in ways that AI cannot fully emulate.”

Empathy, the ability to see another person’s perspective and appreciate their point of view, is a powerful tool. Research suggests that the genuine feeling and expression of empathy has far-reaching effects in our personal and professional lives, and has been linked to better physical health, the maintenance of cognitive function, happiness, resilience, resistance to burnout and better relationships.

Story continues

It has also been associated with professional success, putting pay to the idea of ‘looking after number one’. In a 14-year study from the University of California-Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, those who were generous and agreeable were more likely to be promoted to a position of power.

Empathy can also increase sales and investment opportunities too, as being empathic can help people better understand the motivation of clients, customers and investors.

“Empathy and common sense are invaluable assets in the workplace, each offer very unique qualities that AI cannot replicate,” says Orr. “They enhance collaboration, reduce conflicts, and boost employee engagement. Furthermore, these qualities stimulate innovation, improve customer relations, and aid in sound decision-making.”

Essentially, empathy softens negative emotions — something that AI can’t do. Of course, this is less important if all jobs were to become automated overnight, but research suggests this is unlikely to happen any time soon. In healthcare the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial. (PhonlamaiPhoto via Getty Images)

AI in the workplace

While the new technology is likely to disrupt our workplaces, it will do so by taking on our admin-heavy tasks instead of replacing us completely. In part, a recent MIT study found, this is because AI is too expensive.

There are jobs in which empathy is even more important. Artificial Intelligence has been making significant strides in healthcare, from diagnosis to treatment and research. It has been rightly hailed as a game-changer, but its lack of an ability to empathise is its achilles heel. In healthcare — and particularly mental healthcare — the ability to empathise and connect on a personal, human level with a patient is crucial.

For people in distress, human connection and meaningful relationships are key components of recovery — so much so that compassion is an irreplaceable part of a therapeutic relationship. Having an empathic connection with a doctor, nurse or therapist builds trust, which can encourage compliance with treatments and help patients cope with difficult diagnoses. This is something AI simply can’t replicate and even if we were to create tech that mimics empathy and compassion, it would raise serious ethical problems.

Read more: Will AI make us even lonelier at work?

And, Orr adds, there are other problems with relying too heavily on AI. “It is limited in the workplace when it comes to actual ethical decision making,” she explains. “Moral judgement comes from within a human, so when it's time to fully assess a situation and issue a complex decision it would be very difficult for AI to provide a response that is fair, ethical, and unbiased.”

A good example is discrimination in recruitment. AI can scan job applications and vet applicants quickly and effectively, making what is notoriously a time-consuming process much more streamlined. But, the decisions made by AI are shaped by the initial data it receives. So if the underlying data is unfair, skewed or discriminatory, the resulting algorithms can perpetuate bias, potentially contributing to widespread inequality.

“AI just can't replicate or navigate the complex nuances of various human aspects in the workplace,” says Orr. “Also, AI is very limited when it comes to customer service. It can understand most simple commands and requests, but AI bots truly struggle to offer employees, customers and clients the personalised touch that is needed to provide exemplary customer service.”

2024-01-29T05:13:00+00:00,"Earnings, Fed this week; Evergrande ordered to liquidate - what's moving markets","Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were subdued on Monday, with markets preparing for a busy week of major earnings and central bank policy announcements. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are among many of the tech giants due to report results this week, while the Federal Reserve will unveil its latest policy decision and deliver closely-watched commentary that could help determine the path ahead for interest rates. China Evergrande (HK:3333) is ordered to liquidate, starting a new and possibly lengthy chapter for the heavily indebted property developer.

1. Futures mixed

U.S. stock futures hovered around both sides of the flatline on Monday, as traders geared up for a week of key corporate earnings and central bank decisions.

By 05:07 ET (10:07 GMT), the Dow futures contract had shed 55 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had dipped by 3 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had added 19 points or 0.1%.

A solid start to the new year for the main averages on Wall Street will likely face a stern exam in the coming days. Investors will be parsing through numbers from some of America's largest businesses and digesting influential commentary from the Federal Reserve, both of which may help clarify the outlook for the broader economy (see below).

The S&P 500 dipped by 0.1% on Friday, leaving the benchmark index near all-time highs, a move that reflects market hopes that inflation may be cooling without a meltdown in growth -- a scenario commonly referred to as a ""soft landing."" The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also fell by 0.4% to end the prior trading week, while the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.2%.

2. Big-name earnings ahead

A parade of high-profile and possibly market-moving results are due out from a string of companies this week, including many of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that have powered a recent surge in equities.

On Tuesday, Microsoft will report after the bell, only days after the tech giant's market capitalization surpassed $3 trillion. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which like Microsoft has been a beneficiary of a wave of hype around artificial intelligence, will also unveil its latest numbers following the close of markets.

Story continues

Wednesday will feature semiconductor manufacturer Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), with investors on the lookout for the San Diego-based group's view of the year ahead for chipmaking. Quarterly figures are also due from Boeing (NYSE:BA), the embattled planemaker who has come under fresh scrutiny following a dangerous mid-flight blowout on one of its 737 Max 9 models earlier this month, as well as Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), the Danish drugmaker behind the popular weight loss medication Wegovy.

More megacap tech firms are set to step into the limelight on Thursday, including iPhone-maker Apple, e-commerce behemoth Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).

3. Fed decision in focus

Markets will also be keeping their eye on the Federal Reserve, as the world's most influential central bank holds its latest two-day policy meeting.

Fed officials are tipped to keep interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs following the gathering on Wednesday, placing extra focus on any comments regarding the outlook for borrowing costs in the near term.

In December, the Fed signaled that it could reduce rates six times this year, fueling hopes for a cut as early as March. But several policymakers have moved to temper these expectations, indicating that worries remain that a rapid loosening in financial conditions could reignite cooling inflationary pressures.

A stronger-than-expected advance estimate of fourth-quarter U.S. growth last week also bolstered the case for the Fed to hold off on lowering rates any time soon. Meanwhile, economists expect January nonfarm payrolls on Friday to show ongoing resilience in the U.S. labor market -- although the Fed will not be able to factor this particular piece of data into its latest projections.

How the Fed sees price gains and economic activity evolving in 2024 will likely influence bets over the timing of the first cut. According to Investing.com's Fed Rate Monitor Tool, there is an almost 50% chance the bank will roll it out in May.

4. China Evergrande ordered to liquidate

China Evergrande has been ordered to be wound up by a Hong Kong court after the world's most indebted property developer failed to secure a restructuring agreement with its creditors.

The group, which has over $300 billion in total liabilities, has been attempting to secure the deal for more than two years in the wake of a bond repayment and a series of court hearings.

But Justice Linda Chan on Monday appointed management consultancy Alvarez&Marsal to liquidate Evergrande, arguing that the move will provide some certainty to creditors. ""It is time for the court to say enough is enough,"" Chan said in the morning court session, Reuters reported.

Evergrande's Chief Executive Siu Shawn told Chinese media that the decision will not impact the operations of its onshore and offshore units. But analysts have flagged that the liquidation process could be complicated and lengthy, as well as damaging to already downbeat sentiment around the state of China's property market.

Shares in Evergrande slumped by just under 21% after the announcement.

5. Crude volatile amid Middle East turmoil

Oil prices were choppy on Monday, as traders fretted over increased disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.

By 05:08 ET, the U.S. crude futures contract traded 0.4% lower at $77.73 a barrel, while the Brent contract fell 0.3% to $82.68 per barrel. Both contracts had risen earlier in the day.

The attack, which U.S. President Joe Biden said was carried out by Iran-backed militants, resulted in the death of three American service members. It was the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

Iran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns over a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.

At 03:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.3% lower, while the CAC 40 in France traded 0.1% higher and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. rose 0.1%.

Fed to meet on Wednesday

Investors have started the new week on a cautious note, with the main indices trading in tight ranges ahead of a potentially crucial policy-setting by the Federal Reserve.

The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.

The U.S. is set to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.

The Bank of England also meets this week, and is also expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday, following on from the European Central Bank keeping interest rates unchanged at a record-high 4% last week.

Ryanair trims annual profit forecast

In the corporate sector, Ryanair (IR:RYA) stock fell 2.9% after the budget airline trimmed its profit forecast for the year to the end of March after some online travel agents stopped selling its flights in December, forcing it to cut fares to fill seats.

Philips (AS:PHG) stock fell 4.4% after the Dutch medical device maker reported another loss in 2023, even though the losses were trimmed compared with the previous year, as it seeks to bounce back from a series of damaging recalls.

Additionally, in the U.S., Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.

Crude gains on Middle East turmoil

Oil prices rose Monday on increased worries of disruptions to supply in the Middle East following a drone attack on U.S. forces in Jordan over the weekend.

By 03:25 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.3% higher at $78.25 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.3% to $83.21 a barrel.

Both contracts rose last week for a second week in a row and settled at their highest in nearly two months on Friday.

This attack was by Iran-backed militants, according to the U.S. President Joe Biden, and resulted in the death of three U.S. service members, the first deadly strike against U.S. forces since the Israel-Hamas war erupted.

Iran has denied involvement in the attack, but it does raise concerns of a more direct confrontation between the two countries, potentially resulting in regional energy supply disruptions in the oil-rich Middle East.

Additionally, gold futures rose 0.7% to $2,050.85/oz, while EUR/USD traded 0.1% higher at 1.0840.

2024-01-29T01:07:57+00:00,7 ‘AgeTech’ Stocks to Profit From the Booming Longevity Market,"While it doesn’t seem like it when you’re young, aging happens to everyone and therefore, so-called AgeTech stocks should benefit from inevitability. A buzzword for age-related technology, this concept refers to a rapidly growing field focused on developing and applying innovative solutions to improve the lives of senior citizens. The segment encompasses the full range of aging needs, from maintaining health to enhancing independence.

Fundamentally, these longevity stocks benefit from simple math. As an AP report noted last year, America aged rapidly as baby boomers grew older and births dropped. And that came about because when the baby boomer generation was born, the cohort represented a swarm of new humanity as the U.S. entered a post-war resurgence. However, as with anything in life, there is an ebb and flow.

Thanks to the rise in medical and therapeutic technologies, people have the opportunity to live longer than ever. Logically, that will impact society for years to come. At least from a narrative standpoint, these AgeTech stocks should command longstanding relevance.

Ordinarily, you’d think of Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) as one of the top retail enterprises, not an AgeTech stock. However, it’s been moving into the senior care realm. Last year, the company’s Best Buy Health unit – which seeks to enrich lives through technology – updated its Lively plan to better help seniors stay connected, safe, and healthy.

For a subscription fee, Best Buy connects its senior users with a knowledgeable, caring team to address urgent matters, day or night. Just based on current trends, demand for such services could rise. According to a Pew Research Center report in November 2020, the pace of boomer retirements accelerated versus the prior year. Such a dynamic will continue to “exacerbate” for lack of a better word for years to come.

Story continues

Of course, longevity stocks can be a tricky element because of the niche focus. Fortunately, Best Buy is a diversified retailer, serving multiple consumer needs. Better yet, shares are available at a discount, trading at just under 12X forward earnings. If you want an AgeTech stock you can trust, BBY seems a reasonable deal.

At first glance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) doesn’t seem the most compelling example of AgeTech stocks. After all, the company’s products tend to cater to the hipper, younger audience – you know, the kind that are glued to its smart devices. However, Apple’s versatility makes it an excellent candidate among longevity stocks. As well, its ubiquity doesn’t hurt one bit.

For one thing, Apple has dove headfirst into the consumer wearable technology market. True, that doesn’t necessarily translate to direct relevance regarding AgeTech stocks. However, the Apple Watch features a fall detection feature, which can automatically connect the unfortunate user to emergency services if needed. Further, for years, the tech juggernaut has incorporated emergency SOS services into its iPhones. That’s useful for anyone in need, especially senior citizens.

Further, a report came out that a doctor was able to save a plane passenger’s life using an Apple Watch borrowed from a flight attendant. That just goes to show you how powerful these smart devices are. If you’re looking for a viable AgeTech stock, AAPL should be on your must-have list.

A multinational technology corporation, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) also doesn’t immediately resonate as an AgeTech stock. Instead, the company is well known for its software, especially its Microsoft Office suite of word processors, spreadsheets and other necessities of white-collar life. Also, the company dominates in the desktop operating system arena. If you’re not fluent in Microsoft, you’re not getting very far in this modern ecosystem.

That said, Microsoft isn’t only about spreadsheets and Xboxes. For example, the company offers accessibility tools for mental health, including people who suffer from bipolar disorder, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. Although mental health risks aren’t exclusively a phenomenon impacting seniors, it’s important to note their vulnerability. Per the World Health Organization, loneliness and social isolation represent risks in later life.

As well, Microsoft’s latest operating system upgrade features options such as larger text, voice control and simplified interfaces. Combine that with its stout financials and MSFT easily ranks among the top AgeTech stocks. Analysts also rate shares a unanimous strong buy (among 35 expert voices).

Teladoc (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.

Based on price action, Teladoc (NYSE:TDOC) shares incurred a rags-to-riches-back-to-rags tale and it’s no surprise why. Back during the worst of the Covid-19 disaster, Teladoc – which offered telehealth services – commanded obvious relevance. During that time, no one wanted to be around other people. With telehealth, patients could interact with their doctors in the privacy of their own homes.

However, with the fading of fears of the SARS-Cov-2 virus came a quick erosion of TDOC. Once a bright prospect among longevity stocks, Teladoc struggled for traction. Even now, its trailing 52-week performance leaves much room for improvement. Nevertheless, don’t be surprised if TDOC makes a second comeback. Notably, its short interest stands at 14% of its float, which is quite elevated, begging for a contrarian response.

As for its relevance as an AgeTech stock, seniors may see reduced mobility; for example, many may lose their ability to drive. Naturally, such an obstacle would crimp in-person medical visits. However, Teladoc could easily bridge the gap, providing care at the source. Thus, it makes a strong case for longevity stocks.

Abbott Laboratories (ABT) Close up of Abbott Laboratories sign at their headquarters in Silicon Valley

A multinational medical devices and healthcare company, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) offers effectively permanent relevance. Regarding its core business, Abbott may be best known recently for its diabetes management system known as FreeStyle Libre. Featuring a discreet profile with accurate readings, Libre also does away with fingersticks, which can cause pain or discomfort.

Now, (type 2) diabetes is not exclusively a problem for seniors. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, the risk of this condition materializing increases with age, especially after 35 years. Therefore, seniors fall into a clear risk category, making ABT a pertinent Agetech stock. Also, Abbott invests heavily in artificial-intelligence-powered diagnostics and personalized medicine approaches. Both can lead to early disease detection, which is particularly important for aging populations.

Plus, Abbott has a clear advantage over many other AgeTech stocks thanks to its reliable passive income. Currently, its forward yield is 1.99%, which isn’t that impressive. However, the company has increased its payout consecutively across 52 years. That most certainly is impressive – and so is its strong buy rating with a $125.70 price target.

Cigna (CI) Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.

Based in Bloomfield, Connecticut, Cigna (NYSE:CI) is a for-profit multinational managed healthcare and insurance firm. According to its corporate profile, Cigna’s insurance subsidiaries represent major providers of medical, dental, disability, life, and accident insurance and related products and services. To be sure, investors probably won’t get rich off of CI stock. Rather, it’s a slow-and-steady mechanism to build wealth.

Fundamentally, Cigna ranks among the AgeTech stocks due to its Medicare Advantage plans, which include innovative benefits such as telehealth access, chronic disease management programs, and in-home care services. All of these services should resonate with seniors and their unique challenges. Also, Cigna approaches the aging population in a holistic sense, partnering with other organizations to provide mental health support for older adults and other vulnerable populations.

Moving onto the financials, Cigna doesn’t exactly have standout statistics other than its consistent profitability. However, it keeps the boat afloat with very few fiscal concerns. As a bonus, CI trades at a forward earnings multiple of 10.76X, lower than the sector median 12.77X. Thus, it’s an intriguing AgeTech stock.

ReWalk Robotics (RWLK) Image of a person using an exoskeleton and crutches to walk.

Coming to the last idea for AgeTech stocks, I’m going to end on a speculative note. I’ve discussed ReWalk Robotics (NASDAQ:RWLK) before, which develops and markets exoskeletons that help individuals with spinal cord injuries regain walking ability. It’s a fascinating enterprise, which offers hope for many mobility-challenged individuals.

Looking at its website, the company appears to focus on restoring functionalities for people who have suffered injury or physical trauma (i.e. wounded veterans). However, ReWalk also offers the ReStore Soft Exo-Suit, which represents a “revolution” in post-stroke gait training. Essentially, the platform facilitates rehabilitation for people with lower limb disability due to the effects of a stroke. And yes – age is definitely a factor when assessing stroke risk.

As exciting as ReWalk’s exoskeleton business is, we have to be honest with each other: RWLK is incredibly treacherous. Over the trailing month, it has danced around the demarcation point separating the literal and metaphorical definition of penny stocks. It also features a market capitalization that’s barely above the nano-cap threshold.

Still, if you’re willing to take risks with your AgeTech stocks, RWLK should be on your radar.

2024-01-28T19:28:03+00:00,"Dow futures slip, tech earnings and Fed policy decision in focus","Investing.com - US stock futures were trading lower during Sunday night, as investors turned attention to major technology earnings reports as well as the Federal Reserve interest rates decision.

By 6:35 pm ET (11:15 pm GMT) Dow Jones Futures dipped 0.2% while S&P 500 Futures and Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.3% apiece.

The previous trading week saw all three major indexes rise, buoyed by positive economic data. The US economy displayed stronger-than-expected growth in Q4, while annual core inflation was lower than economists' predictions, hinting at a possible slowdown in price hikes. However, the market's gains were somewhat subdued compared to the rally of the week before, following disappointing earnings reports from major companies such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).

The upcoming week is set to be eventful, with the Federal Reserve's first policy meeting of the year on the agenda, accompanied by significant data releases such as the nonfarm payrolls, ISM Manufacturing PMI, and JOLTs job openings. The Fed is anticipated to keep interest rates at their 23-year high, with investors keen to discern any signals about the timing of rate cuts this year.

On the data front, it's expected that non-farm payrolls may have increased by 162K in January, a slowdown from the 216K rise in December. The unemployment rate is predicted to remain stable at 3.7% for a second period, while monthly wage growth is likely to ease to 0.3% from 0.4%. The ISM PMI is expected to continue signaling a contraction in the manufacturing sector at the year's start.

Investors will also be keeping a close eye on the ADP employment change, Q4 labor productivity and employment costs, factory orders, and regional industry indexes such as the Chicago PMI and Dallas Fed Manufacturing Index.

The ongoing earnings season will continue to make headlines, with a roster of key companies set to report, including tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and others such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), Merck & Company Inc (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX).

2024-01-28T18:13:04+00:00,"A Fed meeting, big tech earnings and the January jobs report: What to know this week","Stocks closed out another week hovering near record highs as one of the busiest weeks of the quarter is set to greet investors.

Earnings from five of the""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) — will highlight a packed week of quarterly reports. In all, 106 S&P 500 companies including six Dow components are slated to report in the week ahead, per FactSet.

On Wednesday afternoon, the Fed is set to announce its latest policy decision. Investors expect the central bank will leave interest rates unchanged in a range of 5.25% to 5.50%. Investors will be closely watching for any commentary during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's conference on Wednesday about when the Federal Reserve may begin cutting rates.

On Friday, the January jobs report is set for release where economists expect a modest tick down in job additions while the unemployment rate is projected to remain flat at 3.7%.

Elsewhere on the schedule, key updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors of the economy, as well as the latest data on job openings, highlight the economic side of things.

Outside of big tech, results from AMD (AMD), Starbucks (SBUX), Pfizer (PFE), CVX), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Boeing (BA) headline the reporting calendar.

Stocks will enter the final week of the month near all-time highs. After a rocky start to the year, both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) are up over 2% so far in January. Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) is up more than 1%.

The market narrative has shifted significantly since the last time Jerome Powell took the podium in December. Investors aggressively priced in a March cut and then scaled back those bets as economic growth has continued to surprise to the upside.

But with inflation down to its lowest levels in nearly three years, many Wall Street economists still believe that the Fed will begin cutting in the near future.

Story continues

""It is time for Fed officials to take the win and start dialing back the level of policy restrictiveness soon,"" Capital Economics deputy chief US economist Andrew Hunter wrote in a note to clients on Friday.

Investor bets are still mixed on when that cut will come. As of Friday afternoon, markets had priced in a 47% chance the Fed cuts rates in March, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Looking out to May, investors believe there is a 88% chance rates are lower by the end of that meeting.

Bank of America US economist Michael Gapen expects the Fed to change its post-meeting statement to more neutral language about the restrictiveness of policy, serving as ""a de-facto easing bias."" But he doesn't believe Powell and the central bank will fully tip their hand just yet.

""Labor markets have cooled, and inflation has come down more rapidly than expected absent a large rise in unemployment, but we don't think the Fed is ready to send a strong signal about its intentions just yet,"" Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell arrives to speak at a press conference following a closed two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on interest rate policy at the Federal Reserve in Washington, U.S., December 13, 2023. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque (REUTERS / Reuters)

Gapen believes the Fed will be buying time to see more data. And some of that data will come in the days following the Fed meeting.

The January jobs report is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. And while layoffs have dominated headlines in recent weeks, economists expect any signs of a broad labor market slowdown to remain absent from the data.

The report is expected to show 175, 000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month with unemploymentticking up slightly to 3.8%, according to data from Bloomberg. In December, the US economy added 216,000 jobs while the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.7%.

""All told, the themes of improving supply, cooling demand and overall labor market normalization likely continued in January,"" Wells Fargo's team of economists led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients. ""Although payroll growth has held up remarkably well recently, there are several signs of further moderation in the months ahead. On net, fewer industries are adding headcounts each month and job openings and hiring plans continue to pull back.""

As if the economic calendar alone wouldn't be enough to keep investors on their toes, the biggest corporate earnings week of the quarter will also set the stage for how companies are holding up amid the higher interest rate environment.

Analysis from FactSet on Friday shows just how much upcoming earnings could drive the market narrative. Excluding Tesla, the other ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks are expected to be the top six earnings drivers for the S&P 500, contributing year-over-year earnings growth of 53.7%. Excluding those six companies the remaining 494 companies would report a 10.5% earnings decline.

Five of those key companies — Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Apple — are set to report in the week ahead.

Evercore ISI managing director Julian Emmanuel described the stock price reaction to these reports as ""critical for overall market direction.""

2024-01-28T14:00:00+00:00,Stock Market’s Fate Rests on $10 Trillion in Big Tech Earnings,"(Bloomberg) -- Investors wondering where the S&P 500 is headed, at least for the next month or so, will want to pay attention to three key days this week.

Between Tuesday and Thursday, five Big Tech companies with a combined market value of more than $10 trillion will report earnings: Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will issue its decision on interest rates, followed by Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference where he’s expected to discuss the outlook ahead.

The stakes couldn’t be much higher, with the S&P 500 Index pushing deeper into record territory on bets that central bankers are poised to began easing monetary policies and tech behemoths like Microsoft getting more valuable by the day.

“Tech disproportionately moved the market last year and big tech continues to have the biggest earnings power, so the results will be crucial for the markets,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.

After a shaky start to the year, the S&P 500 is rising again and on pace for a third monthly advance that’s added more than 18% since late October, when the index hit a near-term low before Fed officials started signaling that rate hikes were over.

The rally is again being led by megacaps including Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Nvidia and Meta Platforms, which were responsible for a majority of the index’s 24% gain last year as investors became captivated by the possibilities of artificial intelligence services. The so-called Magnificent Seven, which also includes Tesla Inc., just hit a record 29% of the S&P 500 despite a slump in shares of the electric-vehicle maker that’s erased more than $200 billion in market value just this month.

AI Booming

Microsoft and Alphabet will kick off earnings on Tuesday after markets close. The two companies are among the best positioned to benefit from the AI boom after investing heavily in the field for years. Microsoft has been adding the features to its suite of software products, and investors are betting that AI will soon start boosting profit and sales growth.

On Wednesday, the focus shifts to the end of the Fed’s January meeting, where it’s expected to hold interest rates steady for a fourth-consecutive meeting. Traders will be primarily focused on what Powell and other policymakers have to say about the timing of easing. Recent data showing inflation continuing to recede and resilient US economic growth suggest central bankers won’t be in a hurry to cut interest rates.

Apple is the biggest draw on Thursday, when Amazon and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms also report in the afternoon. The iPhone maker has been dogged by concerns about revenue growth and is expected to report its first sales expansion in four quarters.

With most of the megacaps in record territory, there are concerns that investors are over exposed to just a handful of stocks, which could open the door for some pain if quarterly results underwhelm.

The Magnificent Seven stocks were again named the most crowded trade in a Bank of America survey of fund managers, according to a research note published by the bank last week.

No Protection

Still, traders aren’t rushing to scoop up hedges against declines, according to options market data.

A gauge of projected price swings in Apple in the next three months is hovering near the lowest level in six years. Traders expect a 3.3% move in the stock in either direction a day after the results, which would be among the narrowest post-earnings swings in two years.

Projected three-month volatility in Meta Platforms, which more than quadrupled since its November 2022 nadir, is at the lowest in two years. The cost of protection against a 10% decline in Microsoft in the next month is hovering near the lowest level since August relative to the cost of options that profit from a similar rally.

Tesla demonstrated the risks last week after missing fourth-quarter earnings estimates and warning that its sales growth would be “notably lower” in 2024. The stock tumbled 12% the following day, its biggest drop in a year.

Microsoft recently overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company with a market value above $3 trillion. The rally has made the stock even more expensive, at 33 times profits projected over the next 12 months compared with an average of 24 times over the past decade.

To Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt, there’s no doubt the megacap trade is crowded. But that doesn’t mean the stocks can’t continue to rally with economic growth slowing and easing financial conditions.

“There’s a good reason for the crowded trade,” he said. “The environment is good for them.”

In a typical example of how the scheme works, borrowers are asked to sign out of their Apple devices and log back in using an Apple ID provided by the lender. If borrowers fail to make repayments on time - usually at interest rates much higher than the market average - the lender threatens to block their device, call their contacts and divulge personal information.

In a recent crackdown, the police arrested nine groups of people involved in these rackets, covering 41 suspects across 21 provinces. The suspects had made loans to more than 20,000 people, involving 130 million yuan (US$18.3 million), according to the state-run China News Service, citing the public security bureau of Wuxi County in southwestern Chongqing city.

Some of the lenders had advertised their services using the surname of Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, according to the report. In a June case in Jiujiang city, Jiangxi province, police arrested 10 suspects from Chuzhou city in neighbouring Anhui province.

State-run Xinhua News Agency warned in 2019 about fraudulent ""Apple ID loan"" cases, with some demanding repayments within a week at exorbitant annualised interest rates of up to 2,800 per cent. Lenders had lured customers to the schemes by promising ""no need for loan collateral or credit reports"".

The rip-off interest rates in such schemes compare with more affordable loans from banks, which have cut rates to boost spending amid economic headwinds. The average interest rate on bank consumer loans dropped to 3.41 per cent in November from 4.2 per cent a year earlier, according to Rong360 Digital Technology Institute, a Beijing-based market researcher.

2024-01-28T05:51:01+00:00,Top 5 things to watch in markets in the week ahead,"Investing.com -- It’s set to be an action-packed week in markets with the Federal Reserve’s first meeting of the year, a flurry of big tech earnings and the latest U.S. jobs report. The Bank of England also holds its first policy meeting of 2024 while data out of China is expected to remain gloomy. Here’s what you need to know to start your week.

Fed ahead

The Fed is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday with investors eagerly awaiting any indication that officials believe they have progressed enough in their battle against inflation to begin cutting rates sooner rather than later.

Investors have pushed expectations for the Fed’s first rate cut to May from March following recent strong economic data and statements from Fed officials that suggested that cuts may not be as aggressive as expected.

Data on Friday indicated that inflation is moderating but consumer spending remains robust, leading to concerns that price pressures could begin to mount again.

Investors will be closely watching Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s post policy meeting press conference for any insights into how officials have been interpreting recent economic data.

Jobs report

Hard on the heels of the Fed decision the U.S. is to release the January jobs report on Friday, with the economy expected to have added 177,000 new jobs, slowing from 216,000 the prior month.

The recent stock market rally which has powered the S&P 500 to record highs has been driven by expectations of a U.S. economic “soft-landing” in which growth remains stable while inflation cools.

A weaker than expected reading could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, while stronger-than-expected hiring could bolster the case for the central bank to keep rates higher for longer.

The economic calendar also includes data on JOLTS job openings and consumer confidence on Tuesday, followed a day later by a report on private sector payrolls and weekly data on initial jobless claims on Thursday.

Megacap earnings

Earnings will be a major focal point in the week ahead with five of the massive “Magnificent Seven” growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reporting.

Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are due to report results on Tuesday, followed by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Thursday with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) closing out the week on Friday.

With the S&P 500 officially in a bull market, the Magnificent Seven's results will be crucial in determining whether the index can maintain its momentum.

Collectively, the market capitalization of Alphabet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta account for nearly 25% of the S&P 500, giving them an outsize influence on the performance of the broader index.

""There’s not this monolithic performance among those stocks anymore,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab told Reuters. ""If there is a downside to earnings … that could take the bloom off the rose"" for the market as a whole.

Bank of England

The BoE is expected to keep interest rates on hold on Thursday and while it may drop its long-held warning that it will hike rates again if inflation rebounds it is expected to indicate that rates need to remain restrictive for an extended period.

The latest U.K. jobs report showed that wage growth rose at the slowest pace in almost a year in the three months to November, but inflation unexpectedly rose to 4% in December.

Britain's economy started 2024 on a stronger footing but data last week indicated that supply disruptions in the Red Sea are reigniting inflation in the manufacturing sector.

The BoE raised interest rates 14 times between December 2021 and August 2023, taking rates to a peak of 5.25% after inflation surged to a 41-year high of 11.1% in late 2022.

China PMIs

China is to release official purchasing managers' index (PMI) data on Wednesday that is likely to show that the world’s second largest economy remains on a shaky footing.

China's economy expanded by 5.2% in 2023, but its post-pandemic recovery has been shaky, with a protracted housing downturn, mounting deflationary risks and slowing global growth casting clouds over the outlook for this year.

China's central bank announced last Wednesday that it was making a 50-basis point cut to bank reserves, the biggest in two years, sending a strong signal of support for a fragile economy and the country's plunging stock markets.

Still, analysts say more stimulus is needed this year to get economic activity on more solid footing.

Apple

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to report earnings for Q1/24 on Feb 1, post-market close. Street estimates stand at $2.10 for earnings per share (EPS) and $118.3 billion for revenues.

Remarkably consistent, Apple has surpassed EPS forecasts in 7 of the last 8 quarters.

On the downside, however, Wall Street anticipates that the Cupertino-California based giant will report sales of $89.28 billion, a decrease of approximately 1% compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous year. This would mark the fourth consecutive quarterly sales decline for the company.

Microsoft

After surpassing the $3 Trillion market-cap line last week, stakes are at a high for the Redmond, Washington-based behemoth when it reports quarterly earnings next Tuesday, the 30th.

Consensus is that the company will post net income of $20.6 billion, or $2.77 per share, compared with $17.4 billion and $2.20 from a year before, respectively.

Should the estimates prove correct, it would mark the highest revenue in seven quarters, coupled with a noteworthy uptick in EPS. Investors are confident that the company's pushes in the AI and cloud spaces will help the giant maintain its momentum.

Going into earnings, Microsoft's Financial Health on InvestingPro scores a 'Great Performance,' with a warning to the company's relative value - suggesting a stretched valuation.

Amazon

Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expected to report earnings for Q4/23 on Feb 1, after the market close. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post an EPS of $0.79 and revenues of $166.3B for the quarter.

DJ Novotney, a vice president of hardware engineering, informed colleagues Friday of his exit, according to people with knowledge of the matter. He will become senior vice president of vehicle programs at Rivian, the maker of electric SUVs and pickup trucks, and report to Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing unannounced matters.

Novotney, who worked at Apple for nearly 25 years, was known as a senior lieutenant to many of the company’s top hardware engineering executives. He was instrumental in the development of several generations of the iPod and iPhone, and was tapped by former hardware chief Dan Riccio to help lead development of the iPad, the people said.

“Great products are what we do best and I have been so very lucky along the way to be part of so many amazing teams that developed everything from iPod, iPhone, iPad, Watch and so many more,” Novotney wrote in a memo to colleagues that was seen by Bloomberg. “Apple has been my life, but now is the time for me to move on and help bring to life a new set of products.”

Novotney also helped bring the Apple Watch to market, having been brought on to the project by Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and former head designer Jony Ive. About a decade ago, Novotney was one of a few executives tapped to kick start Apple’s efforts to develop an electric vehicle — a project codenamed Titan.

Amid a re-organization of the car project following continued setbacks a few years ago, Novotney moved on to become a senior executive in charge of developing future home devices, including some in the robotics and artificial intelligence spaces. Apple has explored a HomePod with a display that can swivel via a robotic arm, Bloomberg News has reported.

Rivian sees the hire as a major coup. Novotney, who is starting at the company on Monday, will be one of about a dozen senior vice presidents. In his new role, he’ll lead product management for products and engineering, making him one of the company’s most critical executives.

Rivian’s Scaringe took the head of product role after the previous executive in charge of development, Nick Kalayjian stepped back, Bloomberg News reported in November. Kalayjian is leaving the carmaker this year and Novotney will take on many of his responsibilities.

Spokespeople for Apple and Rivian declined to comment. Novotney didn’t respond to a request for comment.

For Cupertino-based Apple, the move marks yet another exit in the senior ranks. Tang Tan, Apple’s vice president of product design for the iPhone and Apple Watch, is leaving the company next month for LoveFrom, Ive’s design firm, while hardware technologies leader Steve Hotelling exited late last year. Across 2022 and 2023, it lost a slew of other executives in hardware, operations and services.

Irvine, California-based Rivian has been seen as a leading contender among a handful of EV startups chasing market leader Tesla Inc. It makes two consumer models — battery-electric pickups and sport utility vehicles called R1T and R1S. The company also makes a battery-electric delivery van for Amazon.com Inc. and recently announced it had been freed from exclusivity to sell the last-mile product to others.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) co-founder and then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPad as a ""magical and revolutionary device"" that could do everything from browsing the web, sending and receiving emails, reading books and playing games, among other things.

A ‘Magical' Device

""iPad is our most advanced technology in a magical and revolutionary device at an unbelievable price,"" Jobs said, adding that it would create an ""entirely new category of devices.""

Over the next decade and a half, Jobs was proven right and Apple capitalized on the first-mover advantage — one in two tablets being used worldwide is an iPad, according to data from Statcounter.

Apple put the iPad on sale for the first time on Apr. 3, 2010 and ended up selling over 300,000 units in just one day.

Jobs announced the iPad 2 in March 2011, and revealed that Apple sold 15 million iPads in the first nine months of it going on sale.

Apple has since launched 10 generations of the iPad and, apart from the standard variant, announced Mini, Air and Pro variants.

iPad Is Not Apple's First Tablet

A little fun fact: Did you know the iPad was not Apple's first tablet? Under John Sculley's leadership, Apple launched a tablet-like device called the Newton MessagePad.

""What we want to do is we want to put an incredibly great computer in a book that you can carry around with you and learn how to use in 20 minutes,"" Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said in a 1983 speech.

However, the Newton MessagePad was not well received and was discontinued by Jobs.

Let’s look at how Apple stock has fared since the company launched the iPad 14 years ago.

Apple stock price from Jan. 27, 2010, till today

Apple’s stock, adjusted for stock splits and other corporate actions, was $7.4243 on Jan. 27, 2010.

Story continues

Its stock price today is $194.17, which is an increase of 2,515% during this period.

Value of a $1,000 investment in Apple stock, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indices, respectively, from Jan. 27, 2010, till today

If you had invested $1,000 in Apple stock on Jan. 27, 2010, today, you would have $26,153.

Likewise, if you had invested $1,000 in an index fund replicating Nasdaq, you would have $6,982.

A similar $1,000 investment in an index fund that replicates the S&P 500 would be worth $4,459.

A Multi-billion Dollar Business

Since the iPad's release in 2010, Apple has launched a few other products like the Apple Watch, AirPods, and, more recently, Vision Pro.

Apple's iPads alone made the company over $28 billion in its FY23, accounting for 7.4% of the company’s topline.

Apple has since expanded the use case for iPads from simple reading and entertainment devices to something that can be used by creators as well. The iPad Pro models are tailored for productivity and creation, sporting a large, high-resolution display and featuring powerful M-series chipsets.

Notably, waning iPhone demand out of China has worried investors as Apple had a rocky 2024 start, dealing with several stock downgrades.

CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino breaks down his expectations for Apple and the biggest tailwinds and risks for its various devices.

""As far as those businesses are concerned, the only one that will probably show growth is Mac because some of the new products that they rolled out and easy comps from a year ago, you will probably see some sharp declines specifically on the iPad side of things...,"" Zino notes.

JOSH LIPTON: And Angelo, I want to get your take on another big name reporting next week, and that's Apple. We had tech investor, Dan Niles, on the show this week, Angelo. Not a fan of the iPhone maker. And I think Dan's point was basically-- the argument he made to us, Angelo, is, Why am I going to pay about 30 times for this company where the top line performance is just underwhelming? That seemed to be his core argument. What do you think, Angelo?

ANGELO ZINO: Yeah, I mean, listen, the reason you're paying, you know, high 20s on a 20, 25 basis for Apple is because of that free cash flow potential, right? I mean, this is a company that we think, this year, is going to generate about $110 billion in free cash flow. The best free cash flow generator out there on the planet clearly supporting the buybacks and real stability in that overall business.

So, you know, when we kind of think about here the December quarter results, the two key factors you have to look out for is, one, the services business. That continues to be the main growth driver for this company. You don't necessarily need to see top line growth or significant top line growth to see the earnings growth for Apple.

Story continues

If you actually kind of look in calendar 2023, you're probably looking at about 8% earnings growth on no revenue growth, right? And that's because of that ongoing mix shift towards the services side of things, which essentially is 2x the margins that hardware does. So we need to continue to see good growth on the services side.

And then China is, of course, going to be the other big story out there. If they're showing that China is holding up very well, I think, you know, that's something that kind of alleviates some concerns out there for investors and potentially kind of allows the stock to continue to work here over the next couple of months.

JOSH LIPTON: What about, Angelo, how much focus are you going to have about what they have to say about the kind of non-iPhone hardware in the corner-- in the quarter, Watch, iPad, Mac?

ANGELO ZINO: Yeah, I mean, listen, I think as far as those businesses are concerned, the only one that probably will show growth is Macs because some of the new products that they rolled out and the easy comps from a year ago. You're probably going to see some sharp declines, specifically on the iPad side of things. They didn't have any new products on that side.

And then on wearables side of things, it really is kind of what they have to say about the Vision Pro. And that has the potential to kind of move a couple of basis points on the wearables side of things here over the next couple of quarters, but we're not expecting much on that side of things. So, you know, I'm not looking too much into those type of end markets right now, but, you know, something to definitely keep an eye on.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-services-china-key-q4-130051580.html,"['AAPL.MX', 'AAPL.US', 'AAPL34.SA', 'APC.F', 'APC.XETRA']",[],"{'polarity': 0.983, 'neg': 0.018, 'neu': 0.905, 'pos': 0.077}"

2024-01-27T11:10:00+00:00,My Top Bull Market Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024,"A year ago, the markets were just beginning their recovery from bear times. Growth stocks started to take off, and investors wondered when we could officially call a bull market. Well, that time is now, offering us an excellent start to 2024. The S&P 500 recently hit a new record high, confirming the market is indeed in one of these much-awaited phases of optimism and growth.

In more good news, history shows us bull markets generally last longer than bear markets, offering our portfolios time to benefit. And to maximize your bull market potential, it's a great idea to buy shares of growth stocks. That's because they tend to excel in bull market environments and times of economic recovery and expansion. Here are my top growth stocks to buy in 2024. Image source: Getty Images.

1. Amazon

Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a the ideal growth stock because it's a leader in two high-growth markets: e-commerce and cloud computing. The company also is investing heavily in the hot area of artificial intelligence (AI), which is boosting earnings in two ways.

AI is driving efficiency in Amazon's operations, helping it to lower costs. And Amazon, through cloud computing business Amazon Web Services (AWS), offers AI tools to clients. Considering the high demand in this area, AWS' AI tools could keep these clients coming back, boosting AWS' revenue. This is particularly important since AWS traditionally has driven profit at Amazon.

Amazon's recent efforts to revamp its cost structure -- to fight rising inflation and other challenges -- have been bearing fruit. Back in 2022, the company reported its first annual loss in about a decade. But by early last year, Amazon already was reporting quarterly gains in net income, and its outflow of cash had shifted to an inflow. In the most recent quarter, the company's net income more than tripled, and free cash flow improved to an inflow of more than $21 billion. Return on invested capital also has been on the rise over the past year.

Story continues AMZN Return on Invested Capital Chart

These moves should benefit the company in better times, too. Amazon improved efficiency across its fulfillment network, for example switching to a regional model from a national model in the U.S. The shorter delivery distances are driving improvements in Amazon's ""cost to serve,"" and the company sees potential for ongoing progress here.

So, even though Amazon stock climbed last year, the potential for gains is far from over -- and the stock could be one to excel in this bull market.

2. Carnival

Carnival(NYSE: CCL) had a difficult time of it earlier in the pandemic when sailings were halted, but the world's biggest cruise operator has since roared back to growth. Demand for cruise vacations soared, as we can see in Carnival's revenue and bookings. In the most recent quarter -- the fiscal fourth quarter -- Carnival reported record revenue, and bookings in the two weeks around Black Friday hit an all-time high for that period.

For the fiscal year that ended in November, Carnival reported record revenue of more than $21 billion and entered the new year with its best booked position ever, taking into account occupancy and price. And this has helped the company make gains in earnings, for example, reporting a narrower-than-expected U.S. GAAP net loss of $74 million for the year and positive adjusted net income of $1 million.

Investors' biggest concern about Carnival has been the company's debt levels. While ships were docked during early pandemic days, Carnival built up a wall of debt just to stay afloat (excuse the pun). But Carnival has made significant progress here, too, cutting debt by $4.6 billion from its peak, and Carnival says ongoing growth in adjusted free cash flow will help it pay down more debt over time.

Carnival's booking volumes and customer deposits, which also have reached records, are reason to be optimistic about earnings. And the company's other efforts to streamline operations and cut fuel costs add to earnings growth potential.

That's why now, as Carnival charges ahead in its recovery and growth story, is the perfect time to pick up this stock.

3. Apple

Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a market giant thanks to leading products like the iPhone and Mac computers, but that doesn't mean the company has reached a plateau when it comes to growth. In fact, three things are set to drive earnings growth well into the future. Image source: Getty Images.

The first is Apple's brand strength, which helps keep Apple users coming back to buy the latest iPhone or Apple Watch instead of trying a rival product. This brand strength is part of Apple's moat, or competitive advantage -- a key element that could keep this company ahead over time.

The second growth driver is Apple's services business, which in the most recent quarter reported record revenue. This is because all of those loyal Apple fans also subscribe to certain services through their devices -- from digital content to cloud storage. The enormous user base Apple has built over the years (the installed base of active devices topped 2 billion) now represents a source of recurrent revenue.

And, importantly, gross margins on services are higher than those on products -- 70% compared with 36% in the most recent quarter.

Finally, Apple still continues to gain new customers, so it hasn't yet reached a maximum when it comes to gaining market share. In the quarter, half of Mac and iPad buyers were new to those products.

Considering all of this, Apple's growth story is set to be a long one, and the new bull market may be one of the most exciting chapters -- for the company and for shareholders.

2024-01-27T09:35:28+00:00,11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli,"In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli.

Billionaire Mario Gabelli in 1976 founded Gabelli & Co. as an institutional brokerage house. Over the years the firm went through an evolution and today it's one of the biggest investment firms operating as GAMCO Investors. The 81-year-old billionaire has a net worth of about $1.6 billion according to Forbes. In November 2023, Gabelli, while talking to CNBC, said that the US consumer is an incredibly strong position since the overall net worth of consumers in the country has gone up significantly over the past few years. However, Gabelli said income disparity in the US is high. Gabelli named several spending acts by the US government and said while the Fed is trying to reduce the aggregate demand, the amount of money the US government is putting in the system is having an opposite effect. Gabelli then went on to talk about the ""short-termism"" of the market and said while uncertainties remain and we cannot predict events like the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, one can still make money investing in the stock market.

""You can make a lot of money in the market.. by doing simple things like buying specific stocks.""

But how does Gabelli find ""specific stocks"" to invest in? GAMCO in a report highlighted that instead of always focusing on short-term earnings cycles and news, it focuses on true value of companies and positions itself for long-term earnings trends.

""We want to know everything and anything that will add to, or detract from, our valuation estimates. This method of analysis involves looking at businesses as a function of their assets and earnings power. We examine businesses as if we were owners of those businesses, and we believe that we can do that in a rational way by looking at industries on a global basis. Our investment professionals visit with hundreds of companies each year. Our work is proprietary, bottom up, and involves the full utilization of public resources. We calculate the Private Market Value (PMV) estimate of the business, which is what an informed strategic buyer would pay for a business in its entirety in a private transaction. Effectively, it is the intrinsic value plus a strategic premium. Finally, we look for a catalyst: something happening in the company’s industry or indigenous to the company itself that will help realize returns. A company’s PMV is not constant, and changes as a function of many variables. The objective is to identify large differences between our estimate of PMV and the stock market price. We then identify the catalyst to realize a return with minimal influence from the overall direction of the stock market. It is our belief that we can earn superior risk adjusted returns following this event-driven approach.""

In another interview in August last year, Gabelli said that markets go up and down but what's important is that we want to invest in good companies with strong management and valuations. Gabelli said that there are opportunities beyond just the Magnificent Seven. Undervalued Stocks Picked by Billionaire Gabelli

Gabelli's hedge fund owns a $96 million stake in Enpro Inc (NYSE:NPO) as of the end of the September quarter.

6. American Express Company (NYSE:AXP)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 74

GAMCO's Stake: $97M

American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) ranks sixth in our list of the top undervalued stocks picked by billionaire Mario Gabelli as the payments giant has a PE ratio of 17.08. Deutsche Bank Research analyst Mark DeVries recently started covering American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) along with some other stocks, citing valuation. The analyst said the stock is ""priced for greater economic weakness that seems likely.""

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 74 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) during this period was Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $23 billion stake in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP).

In addition to AXP, hedge funds also like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).

In its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Select Fund stated the following regarding American Express Company (NYSE:AXP):

“American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) is one of the largest credit card issuers and payment networks in the world. We believe the company’s closed-loop network, brand equity and scale represent durable competitive advantages. Unlike most card issuers that process credit card transactions over third-party networks, American Express processes transactions over its own network. This allows American Express to earn greater economics than peers on each card transaction. The company retains part of this advantage in the form of higher profitability and reinvests the rest in enhanced customer rewards and service. Over time, these investments have helped American Express build its brand and attract more lucrative, high-spending card customers. We expect this business model and customer-centric approach will continue to drive industry-leading growth for years to come. Concerns over the near-term economic outlook allowed us to purchase shares of American Express at a 13x P/E on next year’s consensus earnings estimate. We think that is an attractive valuation for a company with this combination of business quality and growth.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Billionaire Mason Hawkins' 5 Stock Picks with Huge Upside Potential.

Otis ""Mason"" Hawkins is a famous value investor who founded Southeastern Asset Management in 1975. Hawkins is estimated to be worth around $1.8 billion and his hedge fund had about $5.5 billion in assets under management as of March 2023. Southeastern Asset Management hunts for bottom-up opportunities around the globe, with the fund's core value and investing philosophy finding its roots in Benjamin Graham's value investing approach. Hawkins is among the traditional class of value investors who staunchly stick to age-old, tried and tested value investing principles. Back in 2008, Hawkins was asked during an interview how he examines intrinsic value of companies. The billionaire said he focuses on free cash flow as he and his team tries to project FCF for the next seven years, ""put a low or no growth terminal multiple on the business past 7 years, and discount back at a conservative discount rate.""

""The second method calculates net asset value by adjusting book values of assets and liabilities to current liquidation values. (For example, real estate is rarely worth the original cost carried on the books, particularly if it’s been held for a long period.) Third, we check our longhand math against a data base of comparable transactions over the last 30 years, taking into account the interest rate environment at the time of the transactions. We mark our appraisal to the lower of the two values when comparable sales and our longhand math differ,"" Hawkins added.

Longleaf Partners Funds, where Hawkins is a co-portfolio manager, is also a notable fund backed by Southeastern and regularly posts its performance and commentary on its website. The fund said in its Q4'2023 letter that it more than doubled the Russell 1000 Value Index, ""almost equalled the tech-led S&P 500 Index and approximately doubled"" its absolute return goal of inflation plus 10%. The fund said when everyone was busy worrying about recession, its team was finding contrarian opportunities:

Story continues

""Our research team was busy in 2023. At the start of the year when everyone was still predicting an imminent recession, we saw opportunity as contrarians and improved our portfolio with weighting changes and compelling new investments, many of which have already contributed to the portfolio. In the fourth quarter, we have seen a growing consensus about a soft landing. This consensus view concerns us for the same reasons we were excited to be buying earlier in the year when everyone was fearful. However, we are confident in our ability to keep delivering double-digit returns with our portfolio of competitively advantaged, financially strong businesses with management teams that can take self-help measures in any environment. 2023 showed us that our investment approach can add meaningful value, even in a challenging period for bottom-up active equity managers."" Mason Hawkins' Top Stocks with Upside Potential

Methodology

For this article we scanned billionaire Mason Hawkins' Q3'2023 portfolio and picked 11 stocks with the highest upside potential from their current prices based on average analyst price estimates. Unlike many other hedge funds, Hawkins' top positions are not in stocks like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the value investor is looking at undervalued companies that are still under the radar. We ranked this list in ascending order of upside potential of these stocks. We also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors for these stocks. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

11. Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 70

Average Analyst Price Estimate: $149

Upside Potential: 6.43%

Billionaire Mason Hawkins owns a $47 million stake in financial services company Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. Yahoo Finance data shows that Wall Street analysts have set a $149 price target on the stock for the next 12 months, while the stock was trading at around $137.

As of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Fiserv Inc (NYSE:FI).

Earlier this month, Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to Outperform from Perform. Oppenheimer's analyst Dominick Gabriele said in his note that Fiserv Inc's (NYSE:FI) ""penetration expectation"" through 2026 is impressive and adds an ""upward upward bias for sustaining high total company margin expansion.""

Giverny Capital Asset Management made the following comment about Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Turning to our new positions, we have been following Fiserv, Inc. (NYSE:FI) for a couple of years now and finally bought a position during the third quarter. Fiserv has two businesses that reinforce each other: it is a key technology provider to several thousand global banks and credit unions. Mid-sized financial institutions need to offer a full complement of digital banking services to compete with larger national banks, but they can’t afford to build out an internal tech capacity. It’s more cost effective to outsource to Fiserv.

Fiserv’s other business is, broadly, payment processing: when you tap and pay at your favorite restaurant or retailer, you may be using a Fiserv device. That device, in turn, may connect directly to the business owner’s bank – and Fiserv built out the bank’s tech stack. The synergy here is important. Fiserv can sell terminals to the restaurant itself, but banks may also sell Fiserv products as part of their customer relationships. There is terrific distribution synergy

For the next few years, Fiserv’s growth should be led by Clover, a payments acceptance system that offers merchants faster transaction times, better fraud protection and stronger operational controls than many existing acceptance networks. While Clover is a clear leader in acceptance, it has a small market share today and could grow at double digit rates for some years. In turn, that should drive solid earnings growth for Fiserv. I believe the stock trades for a low-teens multiple of likely 2024 earnings, an attractive price for a steady compounder.”

10. XPO Inc (NYSE:XPO)

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 33

“Our holdings in the industrials sector also contributed during the quarter. XPO, Inc. (NYSE:XPO), which provides freight transportation services internationally, rallied on the news that industry competitor Yellow had filed for bankruptcy, resulting in market share gains for XPO.”

“Also in the quarter, we initiated a new position in boutique asset manager, Affiliated Managers Group, Inc. (NYSE:AMG). AMG has a unique business model in which it purchases meaningful equity interests in boutique asset management firms and in return receives a fixed percentage of revenues. The Company’s partnership approach allows for its affiliates’ management teams to own significant equity while maintaining operational independence. We believe AMG’s size and scale allow the company to be the leading destination for growing boutique firms addressing succession issues and/or seeking assistance in marketing, distribution and product development. In our view, investors currently underappreciate the company’s active and alternative-asset affiliate business model.”

Baron Discovery Fund made the following comment about Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Liberty Media Corporation-Liberty Live is a tracking stock created on 8/4/2023 representing Liberty Media Corporation’s holdings in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) shares. Those holdings were previously attributed to Liberty SiriusXM and reattributed to a the newly created Liberty Live Group vehicle to reduce the complexity of the Liberty SiriusXM structure and make way for its potential combination with the underlying SiriusXM business. We believe the separation created some selling pressure on Liberty Live, creating an attractive discount of over 40% to the underlying value of its Live Nation holdings, and we took advantage of that discount to build a position. The Liberty Live Group is a small-cap vehicle through which we can own the underlying Live Nation business, which we have tracked and liked for years. Live Nation has significant competitive advantages in the live entertainment industry due to its unique combination of concert promotion, ticketing, venue management, and sponsorship businesses, which create a market share flywheel and margin structure that is difficult for competitors in any one of these underlying sub-segments to replicate independently. In addition to the upside we see in Live Nation, we think Liberty Live Group could eventually transition from a tracking stock to an asset-backed vehicle, which would pave the way for a structure consolidation with Live Nation and allow us to capture the current wide NAV discount.”

2024-01-27T08:17:00+00:00,"Stock Market Curveball: Apple, IBM, and Netflix Just Split Their Stocks, but It's Not What You Think","I subscribe to a plethora of stock market information services. It comes with the job, you know. Earlier this week, several of these tools sent me a whole lot of news announcements, nearly buzzing that phone out of my pocket. I was in for an eye-opening discovery.

A flood of buzzing surprises

According to these unexpected notifications, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) just split its stock. Oh? Maybe they announced it in that game-changing earnings report and nobody noticed? I guess it could happen.

Wait -- International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) did the same thing. Then there's Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), and Toyota Motor(NYSE: TM), just to name a few. There's no way all of these giants could have performed stock splits in unison, like a Gregorian chant of Wall Street accounting tricks, without generating miles and miles of headlines. Besides, I couldn't find the same stock-split announcements through my usual sources, which focus on the American stock market.

So I looked at the notifications again, zeroing in on the stock tickers. And then it hit me.

These stock splits, all taking place on Wednesday, didn't actually involve the American stocks. Every single announcement was about each company's presence on the Argentinian stock market, at the Buenos Aires exchange.

Don't cry for me, Argentina. If anything, I should cry for you.

Yes, Netflix and Apple really did split their stocks this week, but not because their listings on the NYSE and Nasdaq exchanges were growing too pricey. Most of them may get there soon, and I wouldn't be terribly surprised to see a normal Netflix split someday soon -- but Bank of America's shares only cost $33 each.

Things look very different on the Buenos Aires exchange, where investors must struggle with Argentina's incredible hyperinflation. Here, Netflix trades at roughly 14,700 Argentine pesos per share after Wednesday's 3-for-1 stock split. That's about $18 at current exchange rates. But things change fast in Argentina. In early December, the same stash of pesos was worth $41. A year ago, it was $79. It's no wonder that American companies feel the need to adjust their share prices amid this catastrophic exchange-rate trend.

Story continues

The U.S. dollar's inflation rate briefly soared to 9.1% in June 2022. It was a painful jump with game-changing effects on business and personal finance in this country, sparking heavy-handed anti-inflation policies from every level of our government.

The Argentine crisis is orders of magnitude worse. December's prices were 25.5% above November's and 211% higher on the same year-over-year basis you see most often in American inflation reports.

Argentina is teaching me things about value storage

You might think the prices of American stocks on the Buenos Aires exchange are a low priority in times like these. However, Argentinians with the means and foresight to invest in these stable value stores have a powerful financial tool in their hands. As the peso loses its value, alternatives such as stocks, physical gold, or Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC) become incredibly important. Other defensive options include real estate holdings, cars, or bills and coins in foreign currencies such as the dollar.

The total value of Netflix, Toyota, and Apple shares on the Buenos Aires market are always in lockstep with their underlying American counterparts, filtered through the effective currency exchange rates and different number of shares. Tapping into your foreign stock holdings (and other stable assets) can keep food on your table when the pesos in your pocket are turning worthless.

This reminder of the Argentine inflation crisis may not improve my investing strategy by much, but those buzzing notifications opened my eyes to the sheer scale of this monetary disaster. Now I understand why Netflix pointed to the falling peso as a 3% currency-exchange headwind for its top-line growth in the next quarter. And the American situation doesn't seem likely to mirror the Argentine crisis anytime soon, but a healthy reserve of gold or Bitcoin could be a life-saver if the next local inflation crisis is any worse than the recent one.

These stock splits, initially a curiosity, reveal the profound impact of global economic shifts. They underscore a vital truth for investors: the importance of vigilance in an interconnected world and the wisdom of diversifying beyond the traditional stock market. Diversify, stay alert, and maybe keep some Bitcoin or gold handy for a rainy day -- because when it rains on the scale of a national economy, it really pours.

2024-01-27T06:35:23+00:00,Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX): A Metaverse Stock Investors Shouldn’t Forget,"As Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) battle their way into the Metaverse, it’s easy to forget about Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX), a metaverse play that’s already proven how lucrative the market can be, especially for young audiences. Indeed, the Metaverse is more about gaming or work. Roblox’s platform has shown us just how profound digital “experiences” can be and how a metaverse-like universe can connect us in ways we never thought possible.

As the Metaverse term looks to make its way to the top of headlines (again) in 2024, Roblox will be a stock to watch as it looks to climb out of the ditch it fell into back in late 2021 and early 2022. At this juncture, Wall Street is just mildly optimistic about the firm’s prospects over the year ahead. Personally, I think Wall Street is a tad too cautious on Roblox stock, given the potential for the Metaverse to make a significant comeback in the new year as Apple looks to test the market with its Vision Pro headset.

It’s not hard to imagine many folks underestimating metaverse plays like Roblox this year. As the company looks to add to its ecosystem in 2024, I can’t help but stay bullish on the stock.

Roblox’s Recent Momentum Can Continue, as Metaverse Hype Can Grow Again

Indeed, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been the hottest of the hot tech trends over the past year, and while it seems tough to top, I think the Metaverse could re-emerge as a theme that attracts some of the investors who believe gen AI has gotten a tad too ahead of itself.

Apple’s massive user base will begin to explore an all-new medium (augmented and virtual reality), which could prove the successor of personal computers. Whether Roblox will be quick to launch a Vision Pro app remains to be seen, as many firms seem to be holding out in these initial stages. Regardless, I’d not discount the power of Roblox as the Metaverse investment theme looks to heat up again.

Just last week, Roth MKM reiterated its Buy rating on shares of RBLX (with a $50.00 price target, implying 23.7% upside), citing their belief that the year could be “bright” for the firm. Roth analysts Eric Handler and Rohit Kulkarni both like the stock and its “very attractive setup” that could beef up bookings growth from here.

Story continues

I’m in agreement. Handler and Kulkarni really do understand Roblox’s growth narrative. With many growth and monetization levers to pull, it’s likely a mistake to think Roblox stock is destined for another year of consolidation.

Roblox stock has been on a nice run since bottoming out in autumn, with shares now up around 60% from their 52-week lows of approximately $25 per share. Even with the recent 13% correction off 52-week highs, Roblox still looks incredibly intriguing if you’re in the belief that the Metaverse trend could return to the spotlight again while the company does its best to get its wheels fully back on the growth track.

Roblox Has a Wide Moat, but There are Competitors Out There

Roblox’s ecosystem is impressive and acts as a flywheel for growth as more users create content to win over the engagement of fellow players. With many different worlds and experiences available to players, the possibilities of digital places to hang out with friends are virtually endless. Roblox isn’t the only video game firm to implement such a model, though.

Fortnite is an incredibly popular Battle Royale game that’s become quite Roblox-like with recent updates. With a wide selection of user-generated worlds and games, Fortnite stands out as a potential threat that could take a big chunk of Roblox’s lunch, especially from older gaming audiences.

Fortunately, Roblox is doing its best to stay relevant with its users, even as they grow up. Though industry dynamics are sure to shift with every new industry combatant, I’d not be so quick to count Roblox out of the game.

In a prior piece, I highlighted the importance of maintaining attraction with users as they age. Thus far, Roblox has done a reasonable job, but whether it can outcompete ever-strengthening rivals for engagement remains to be seen.

Is RBLX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?

On TipRanks, RBLX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 22 analyst ratings, there are 15 Buys, four Hold recommendations, and three Sell recommendations. The average RBLX stock price target is $44.74, implying upside potential of 10.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $21.00 per share to a high of $55.00 per share.

The Bottom Line on Roblox Stock

There’s a lot to love about Roblox stock as the Metaverse looks to reappear in the limelight this year. Though Roblox has numerous levers it can pull to gain traction in 2024, investors must also keep tabs on rivals as more companies recognize the economic profits to be had in the realm of the Metaverse and its like.

For more than an hour leading up to 7:42 p.m. New York time, “users may have been unable to make purchases in the iTunes Store, Mac App Store and App Store,” the company said on its system status page. Users of Apple Music, meanwhile, also suffered “intermittent issues with the service,” the iPhone maker said. The problems have now been fixed, Apple said.

The outages came the same week that Apple announced sweeping changes to the App Store in the European Union. That overhaul — coming in March as part of Apple’s iOS 17.4 operating system — is a direct response to the EU’s new Digital Markets Act, which imposes rigid restrictions on the largest tech firms.

Friday’s outages also included problems at Apple’s subscription purchase feature, which was having “intermittent issues.”

2024-01-26T23:53:36+00:00,Spotify says Apple's plan to comply with EU regulation 'farce',"(Reuters) - Spotify said on Friday that Apple's new plan to comply with the European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA) is ""a complete and total farce.""

From early March, developers will be able to offer alternative app stores on iPhones and opt out of using Apple's in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up to 30%, under the bloc's new rules.

However, developers will still be required to pay a ""core technology fee"" of 50 euro cents per user account per year under Apple's new EU regime.

""From the beginning, Apple has been clear that they didn't like the idea of abiding by the DMA. So they've formulated an undesirable alternative to the status quo,"" the music streaming-giant said on Friday.

Spotify said it would have to pay a 17% commission if it stays in the App Store and offers its own in-app payment under the new terms.

""Every developer can choose to stay on the same terms in place today. And under the new terms, more than 99% of developers would pay the same or less to Apple,"" Apple said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

Apple faces strong action if changes to its App Store do not meet incoming regulations, the bloc's industry chief exclusively told Reuters on Friday.

2024-01-26T23:20:00+00:00,3 Key Quarterly Releases to Watch Next Week,"Earnings season continues to chug along, with various companies reporting quarterly results daily. The period is undoubtedly an exciting time for investors, as companies finally pull the curtain back and unveil what’s transpired throughout the period.

This upcoming week, we have several notable names on the reporting docket, a list that includes several mega-cap tech favorites such as Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, and Apple AAPL.

It raises a valid question – what are analysts expecting out of each? Let’s take a closer dive into quarterly expectations.

Apple

Perhaps the most beloved of the bunch, market leader Apple will reveal quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has been on a solid earnings streak as of late, exceeding our consensus earnings and revenue expectations in three consecutive quarters.

Shares got a nice boost following its latest set of results, sparking a strong rally. Zacks Investment Research

Analysts have been bullish regarding the bottom line, with the $2.09 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up a modest 1.5% since November and suggesting growth of roughly 11% year-over-year. Revenue expectations have been slightly more negative, as the $117 billion quarterly sales estimate has been taken 1.4% lower over the same period. Zacks Investment Research

Of course, investors will be focused on the company’s iPhone sales, but Apple’s services portfolio has also been a great source of growth over the last several years. For the quarter, we expect the company to post $23.3 billion in revenue from Services, nicely above the year-ago mark of $20.7 billion.

Apple has consistently positively surprised on this metric as of late, as we can see below. Zacks Investment Research

Amazon

Amazon, the e-commerce and cloud computing titan, will report on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has posted strong quarterly results as of late, exceeding our consensus EPS expectations by an average of 55% over its last four releases.

Like AAPL, Amazon shares moved well higher post-earnings following its latest release, with shares continuing their momentum throughout 2024 so far. Zacks Investment Research

Analysts have been notably bullish for the release, as the $0.81 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has been taken nearly 7% higher since November and reflects growth of a sizable 280% year-over-year. Top line expectations have primarily remained flat. Zacks Investment Research

Concerning Amazon, AWS will likely be yet again a big focus among investors. For the release, the Zacks Consensus estimate for AWS sales stands at $24.3 billion, reflecting solid growth from the year-ago mark of $21.4 billion.

Meta Platforms

Like those above, Meta Platforms is scheduled to unveil its quarterly results on February 1st after the market’s close. The company has crushed earnings expectations as of late, exceeding both earnings and revenue estimates in four consecutive releases.

Shares faced modest pressure post-earnings following its latest release before quickly rebounding and melting higher. Zacks Investment Research

Analysts have been bullish on tech’s outlook, and Meta certainly hasn’t been an exception, with the $4.81 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate up 2% since last November and indicating growth of 60%. Top line revisions have moved similarly, as the $38.9 billion consensus sales estimate has climbed 1% over the same period. Zacks Investment Research

The company generates the bulk of its revenues through advertising, a metric that META has consistently positively surprised on as of late. For the quarter to be reported, the Zacks Consensus estimate for advertising net sales stands at $37.8 billion, showing considerable growth from last year’s $31.3 billion print.

2024-01-26T21:22:00+00:00,3 Magnificent 7 Tech Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever,"Today’s episode of Full Court Finance at Zacks looks at where the market stands after the early wave of big tech earnings reports from the likes of Tesla and Netflix. The episode then explores why investors might want to buy three of the Magnificent 7 technology stocks—Meta, Apple, and Amazon—with their quarterly earnings results due out on February 1.

The S&P 500 is trading near its new all-time highs heading into the most highly-anticipated week of corporate earnings that features reports from Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and other giants.

Netflix, United Rentals, and American Airlines all surged following their financial releases, highlighting the ongoing strength of U.S. consumers and the wider economy.

Tesla was one of the standout underperformers thus far. But Wall Street might start to nibble at the EV giant sooner than later considering the oversold levels it is trading at.

There is no telling how Wall Street will react to the wave of Magnificent 7 reports next week. On top of that, there is little doubt that these big tech names and the broader market will face selling pressure and pull back down to key moving averages at some point again because that is always the case even in strong bull markets.

But the last several years have showcased how tricky the market timing game can be and why investors might want to adopt buy-and-hold mentalities. On top of that, owning some of these mega-cap tech giants is likely savvy investing even if it seems far too easy.

Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) shares are trading at new all-time highs ahead of its Q4 earnings release on February 1, skyrocketing 160% in the last year. Yet, Meta trades at a 16% discount to the Zacks tech sector, 10% below its 10-year median, and nearly 70% below its highs at 22.1X forward 12-month earnings.

The stock might be a little overheated, but it is still trading above all of its key short-term and longer-term moving averages. Zacks Investment Research

Story continues

The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp grew its daily active user (people) base by 7% last quarter to 3.14 billion, while its monthly active users popped 7% to 3.96 billion, reaching half of the global population.

Meta’s various apps serve different pockets of social media and digital communication, and the firm stands to benefit from ongoing ad spending in a world of smartphone addicts. Meta is also investing in its AI future and it could still be a long-term winner if the metaverse dream becomes a reality.  Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

In the here and now, Meta is poised to churn out profits as it focuses on steady expansion and efficiency. Meta is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 46% in FY23 and another 23% in FY24 on the back of 15% and 14%, respective revenue growth. Meta’s positive earnings revisions activity helps it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now.

Amazon (AMZN) is focused on efficiency and profitability these days and is set to report on February 1. AMZN is attempting to improve AWS cloud computing margins by rolling out more in-house chips, while also working with Nvidia.

On the e-commerce front, Amazon is boosting profitability through a different fulfillment network structure. AMZN is also growing its digital advertising unit and attempting to attract more Prime subscribers via different streaming offerings and other perks.  Zacks Investment Research

Amazon’s earnings outlook has improved to help it land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. Zacks estimates call for the company to grow its adjusted earnings by 280% in FY23 from $0.71 per share to $2.70 and then expand another 36% in FY24. Meanwhile, AMZN is poised to grow its revenue by 11% and 12%, respectively during this stretch to climb from $514 billion last year to $637 billion in 2024. Zacks Investment Research

Amazon stock has soared 785% in the last decade to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 280%. Despite this run, Amazon is down 2% in the last three years vs. the Zacks Tech sector’s 27% climb and it trades around 15% below its all-time highs.

Amazon’s forward earnings multiple remains rather high. But its focus on bottom-line growth has it looking lightyears better than it was. Amazon’s PEG ratio might also suggest its P/E ratio will continue to come down.

Apple (AAPL), like all of the stocks on the list today doesn’t need an introduction and it reports earnings (Q1 FY24) on February 1.

AAPL stock closed out 2023 on a downbeat note after hitting all-time highs as Wall Street worried about slowing growth in China, a saturated high-end smartphone market, possible legal setbacks, and more. Apple’s revenue did fall by 2.8% last year, but that is rather common given its somewhat cyclical iPhone-heavy business. And the stock is already bouncing back. Zacks Investment Research

Even in a 'down year' Apple sold $200 billion worth of iPhones in FY23 vs. $142 billion in FY19. Plus, CEO Tim Cook has helped turn its iPhones, Macs, and more, which have amassed an installed base of “over 2 billion active devices,” into a separate growth engine via services-focused subscriptions.

The biggest growth segment at the company includes the App Store, streaming TV, and more. AAPL has nearly doubled the number of paid subscriptions it had three years ago to over 1 billion. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

Apple’s revenue is projected to climb by 3% in FY23 and then jump 6% higher in FY25 to boost its adjusted earnings by 8% and 9%, respectively. Apple trades above all of its key short-term and long-term moving averages and it is trading near neutral RSI levels.

Meanwhile, Apple trades at a roughly 20% discount to its five-year highs at 28.6X forward 12-month earnings and not too far above its median and Tech.

2024-01-26T20:46:00+00:00,Earnings Countdown: Mega-Cap Stocks Take the Stage Next Week,"Although next week will not be the most numerous in earnings reports, it will be the most important. Five of the ‘Magnificent Seven’ stocks will be reporting and the two largest American energy companies – sharing with investors some of the most valuable economic data in the world.

Thus far, the earnings season has been generally upbeat with the majority of stocks reporting thus far beating both earnings and revenue estimates.

Technology

From the Zacks Earnings Trend Report from research head Sheraz Mian, he notes that:

“For the Technology sector, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up +18.7% from the same period last year on +6.8% higher revenues. Had it not been for the strong Tech sector contribution, Q4 earnings for the remainder of the index would be down -5.9% (instead of up +0.6% as a whole).

The ‘Big 7 Tech Players’ - Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) - will start reporting Q4 results in the next few days. Total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +38.3% from the same period last year on +12.5% higher revenues, which would follow the group’s +54.2% higher earnings on +12.9% higher revenues in 2023 Q3.”

Which is quite incredible when you think about it. We have many analysts and commentators commenting on how large a portion of the S&P 500 the mega-cap tech stocks have become, but the sales and earnings growth they put up is simply undeniable.

On Tuesday, after the market closes, we will get earnings from Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, and then on Thursday Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, and Meta Platforms META.

I also want to note the valuations on the five tech stocks reporting next week. Although there is much talk of “its only the mag 7 dragging the market higher,” none of them have absurd valuations, and a couple are quite appealing.

We can see that Amazon and Microsoft have the loftiest forward earnings multiples, while Meta Platforms and Alphabet have the lowest and Apple is right in the middle. Both Meta Platforms and Alphabet are trading below their five-year median valuations of 23.3x and 24.2x respectively and are forecasting EPS to grow 21% and 17% annually over the next 3-5 years.

Story continues

Both Microsoft and Apple are trading above their five-year median valuations of 31x and 26x respectively. These are obviously historical premiums, but not excessively high. Microsoft is anticipating annual EPS growth of 15.5% over the next 3-5 years and Apple 12.7%.

And finally, Amazon, with the most premium valuation is actually the farthest below its five-year median of 72.5x. Admittedly, Amazon’s valuation has always been a bit of a conundrum, because the e-commerce business runs with such low margins, but these days it is balanced by Amazon Web services, which is the largest cloud-service provider. AMZN is projecting annual EPS growth of 28.5% over the next 3-5 years. Zacks Investment Research

Image Source: Zacks Investment Research

I think that this data can yield a fairly simple conclusion; based on valuations Meta Platforms and Alphabet are quite appealing, while Microsoft and Apple may have to work off their premium multiples before they are as attractive. Amazon looks appealing as well based on its very high earnings growth expectations.

It is also worth noting that Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Apple and Alphabet have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.

Energy

Regarding earnings expectations, energy stocks are on the completely other side of the spectrum from Technology. From the Earnings Trend Report:

“Sectors expected to experience the biggest earnings declines in Q4 include Autos, Basic Materials, Medical, Energy, and Transportation.”

Energy stocks have struggled over the last year primarily due to the easing of Oil prices. Following the start of Ukraine-Russia war, and easing of inflation, the price of crude oil has steadily fallen from the $130 highs to $78 today, with intermittent spikes up to $95.

This reflects the cyclical nature of investing in oil stocks and doesn’t come as to big a surprise. But even with expectations of falling YoY earnings, I think this sector is still rather appealing, and worth considering as investments.

On Friday, US oil majors Exxon Mobil XOM and Chevron CVX report earnings before the market opens.

Like the technology stocks, when looking at energy from a historical valuation perspective it is hard to deny the attractiveness. Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron are trading at very reasonable valuations of ~10x forward earnings, easing considerably from the three-year highs near 30x. But they are also below the 10-year medians, which both stand at ~17.7x.

Chevron and Exxon Mobil also both pay hefty dividends of 4% and 3.7% respectively and have structural tailwinds. The structural tailwinds are namely a broad underinvestment in oil and gas infrastructure, which is likely to keep oil supply low for the coming years.

Both Exxon Mobil and Chevron have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating. Zacks Investment Research

Final Thoughts

The energy and technology sectors offer two very different outlooks regarding earnings, yet both may be appealing based on valuations. Because they are such critical and leading industries in the country, discerning investors would be wise to hold some mix of the stocks shared.

2024-01-26T20:11:10+00:00,The generative AI smartphone age is here,"Generative AI is coming to your smartphone. Yes, the biggest technology trend in years is landing on your most important device. But how exactly it will impact your everyday life is still unclear.

Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung are leading the generative AI charge with their latest smartphones, the Google Pixel 8 and 8 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 lineup, and you can expect others to join the fray, including Apple (AAPL), throughout 2024 and beyond.

Analysts say generative AI capabilities will quickly become table stakes for companies. That will also help tech giants hoping to woo potential smartphone customers and spawn a new upgrade cycle at a time of anemic device sales.

“I think in the not-too-distant future, all phones will have some level of these capabilities,” explained TECHnalysis Research founder and president Bob O’Donnell. “It's the kind of thing that I think … people can just start to expect.”

According to analysts at UBS, generative AI smartphones will start off slow but increase in sales rather fast.

“Combining Apple, smartphone and other Android brands, we project Gen AI smartphones to ramp from 50 [million units] or 4% penetration in 2023 to 583 [million units] or 46% penetration in 2027,” UBS analysts said in a January research note. Samsung is banking on its Galaxy AI offerings to boost sales of its Galaxy S24 line of smartphones. (Samsung) (samsung)

So what can you expect from AI smartphones beyond what your current device can already do? That’s still a surprisingly open question.

Generative AI on the go

Beyond a few apps and features for existing software such as the ability to improve video calls or run photo editing programs locally, companies are light on details as to how generative AI will change the overall user experience.

On the PC side, Microsoft is loading its Copilot app onto Windows 11 machines, but that’s a web-based platform that doesn’t require any particular hardware on your side.

“If I compare PCs and smartphones, I think there's much more hope that smartphones will actually start to, over time, demonstrate real value from AI and Gen AI,” explained Gartner senior research director Ranjit Atwal.

Story continues

According to UBS analysts, generative AI-capable smartphones could improve multimedia content creation; enable fast photo and video editing; and provide better speech-to-text, translation, and enhanced gaming capabilities. Samsung and Google are already offering powerful generative AI photo editing and translation capabilities in their latest devices.

Like all things related to smartphones, Apple will play an outsized role in how generative AI technology makes its way into our devices. But how the company does so will be just as interesting as when it adds the feature to its iPhones.

“Will they do it through Siri and then Siri automatically talks to the other apps, which would be a different way of presenting the same capability? Or … are they going to do something else? I think the devil is going to be in the details of how it’s implemented,” O’Donnell said.

However Apple decides to bring generative AI to the iPhone, though, it will have a distinct advantage over rival Samsung, Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster explained.

That’s because Apple controls every aspect of the iPhone, from the software to the hardware right down to the chip that powers it all. That kind of capability should help Apple ensure that the overall experience is as seamless as possible.

It also doesn’t hurt that Apple has been taking advantage of the neural engine in its A-series chips for years to help power a number of on-device machine learning processes. Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)

According to Apple soothsayer Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will bring generative AI capabilities including auto-summarization for long text and auto-complete writing tools and add generative AI features to the company’s developer tools. Apple, Gurman says, will debut those features at its annual WWDC developer conference in June.

That, however, also means that Apple will be well behind Google and Samsung in bringing generative AI capabilities to market.

But with the full extent of generative AI technologies for smartphones still up in the air, it might not actually matter.

2024-01-26T19:52:23+00:00,Big Tech Announces Another Round of Job Cuts As It Continues Its Expensive Efforts To Turn GenAI Into Business Magic,"According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) hold the highest cash and short-term investment balances among nonbanking companies in the S&P 500 community. Although they are not hurting cash-wise, they are also quite careful about their spending.

Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet entered the new year by announcing more layoffs. Last year, Amazon, Google, along with Microsoft, Meta and Salesforce Inc (NYSE: CRM), trimmed their respective workforces by 6% to 13%, but layoffs started back in 2022, costing several thousand employees their jobs.

New Round Of Layoffs Suggests Big Tech Bit Off More It Can Chew

Last week, Google announced its job cuts across engineering and hardware teams as it continues its push for greater efficiency. Although other parts of the tech giant were affected, mostly impacted were workers in hardware, central engineering and Google Assistant voice-activated software product. As it continues to keep up with its rivals, Microsoft and Amazon, Google eliminated about 12,000 jobs last year under the leadership of Sundar Pichai.

The e-commerce and cloud titan, Amazon laid off hundreds across Twitch, Prime Video and MGM Studios divisions, taking the overall job cuts to 27,000. Last year alone, Amazon laid off about 18,000 employees.

Cutting Jobs To Fund AI Efforts

Although it seems like a strange time for job cuts considering that Big Tech ended 2023 by exiting the post-pandemic slump with the recovery of online advertising, Big Tech is in an expensive arms race to build AI services. Therefore, it is not a surprise that Google and Amazon opted to continue the trend of cost-cutting efforts, while streamlining operations and focusing on key projects. But even though this year will bring increased AI spending, its impact on revenue will likely be limited. Although generative AI is expected to pay out big-time, but turning GenAI magic into the desired top and bottom-line business impact will take time. Microsoft gained the early lead in the AI-race thanks to its partnership with the ChatGPT creator, OpenAI, but Amazon and Google are determined to catch up and to do so, they will need to spend their billions wisely.

2024-01-26T16:11:16+00:00,Apple’s EU app store changes are truly epic—but they may not be enough,"Apple on Thursday announced fundamental changes to the way it runs its mobile business in Europe, to very grudgingly comply with the European Union’s new Digital Markets Act (DMA)—a massive reform of antitrust law that specifically targets Big Tech.

But Apple's move is already facing strong opposition from those who are supposed to benefit from it.

The changes, which the company revealed with stark warnings about the security and privacy implications for European iPhone and iPad users, will make it possible for those users to download alternative app stores, pay for in-app purchases and subscriptions without using Apple’s payment system, and choose to use non-Safari browsers like Chrome or Firefox—which will no longer have to be built on top of Apple’s WebKit engine—from the first time they turn on their device.

However, companies that have long been pushing for the ability to launch rivals to the in-house iOS App Store are deeply displeased with the way Apple has chosen to make the changes.

Epic Games, which has spent years crusading against the massive cut Apple demands for in-app sales, and which intends to launch its own iOS app store in the EU later this year, is the most notable example.

In a blistering X post, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney laid into Apple’s decision to claim a €0.50 ($0.54) “core technology fee” per first installation from developers who choose to distribute very popular apps (i.e. those seeing over 1 million downloads per year) through alternative app stores.

Apple says this would apply to less than 1% of developers, but nonetheless, it would demand that fee whether the installation comes via its own App Store or a rival channel.

“They are forcing developers to choose between App Store exclusivity and the store terms, which will be illegal under [the] DMA, or accept a new also-illegal anticompetitive scheme rife with new Junk Fees on downloads and new Apple taxes on payments they don't process,” Sweeney thundered. (That last point is curious, as Apple explicitly said that “developers can use a payment service provider within their app or link users to their website to process payments for no additional fee to Apple.”)

Story continues

This opposition could well mean that the changes still leave Apple falling foul of the DMA—which comes with the threat of fines theoretically running as high as 20% of global annual revenue.

""The DMA will open the gates of the internet to competition so that digital markets are fair and open. Change is already happening. As from 7 March [the deadline for DMA compliance] we will assess companies' proposals, with the feedback of third parties,” Thierry Breton, the European Commission’s digital chief, told Reuters on Friday.

“If the proposed solutions are not good enough, we will not hesitate to take strong action.”

Asked for comment earlier in the day, a Commission spokesperson told Fortune that the EU executive body—which is in charge of enforcing the DMA—“strongly” encourages Big Tech companies whose platforms fall under the law to “test their proposals with third parties.”

Apple told Fortune that it was sharing its changes with everyone, and that it had previewed them to the Commission in more than 50 meetings.

Epic won’t be the only company griping to the Commission.

Aptoide, which already has an alternative app store for iOS but currently requires users to have “jailbroken” iPhones to use it, also told Reuters that it was preparing to send formal feedback on Apple’s changes. “This was definitely a good move, but the fees are still too high,” said CEO Paulo Trezentos.

Sweeney’s complaint went beyond the issue of fees, also touching on the measures Apple said it would take to mitigate the theoretical security threats posed by alternative app stores.

Apple will still review all iOS apps, regardless of how they're distributed, through a “notarization” procedure entailing both automated and human review—crucially, it will also retain the right to deny authorization to alternative app stores, “to ensure marketplace developers commit to ongoing requirements that help protect users and [app] developers.”

“Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store. They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it, for example, or block Microsoft, Valve, Good Old Games, or new entrants,” Sweeney wrote.

“Epic has always supported the notion of Apple notarization and malware scanning for apps, but we strongly reject Apple's twisting this process to undermine competition.”

The DMA itself states that “gatekeepers” such as Apple will need to apply “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory general conditions of access” for other businesses that want to set up shop on their platforms.

With such strong pushback already evident, there’s a chance that Apple’s changes may not reach those benchmarks.

2024-01-26T15:47:10+00:00,Fortnite is coming back to iPhone – but only in Europe for now,"More than three years after Epic Games removed Fortnite from Apple devices, the publishers/developer is ready to bring it back, but players in the U.S. will have to wait a while longer.

Epic has confirmed it will bring the popular title back to iPhones and iPads in EU markets following Apple’s announcement that it will enabled third-party stores for iOS users.

A timeline for the game’s return hasn’t been set—and Epic’s much-publicized feud with Apple is far from over. Even in its announcement that the game would be returning, Epic added, “We'll continue to argue to the courts and regulators that Apple is breaking the law.”

The key to the return to Apple devices in parts of Europe is the EU’s Digital Markets Act, which (among other things) allows developers to bypass Apple’s app store for payments. That law goes into effect March 7.

While it’s enough to get Epic back on board, the game maker is still taking shots at Apple. CEO and founder Tim Sweeney, in a separate tweet, called Apple’s announcement a “devious new instance of Malicious Compliance”.

“Apple proposes that it can choose which stores are allowed to compete with their App Store. They could block Epic from launching the Epic Games Store and distributing Fortnite through it, for example,” he added. “There's a lot more hot garbage in Apple's announcement. It will take more time to parse both the written and unwritten parts of this new horror show.”

Even without a significant mobile presence, Fortnite ruled supreme in December 2023, topping the as player engagement charts on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox, according to Circana. Some 36% of active PS5 players and 31% of active Xbox Series players played Fortnite at least once during December. That was a 5% bump on Sony’s platform and a 3% increase on Microsoft’s.

2024-01-26T15:05:00+00:00,Apple Lags as Microsoft Sales Hit Highs: US Earnings Week Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- Five of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech megacaps will report earnings next week, with artificial-intelligence investment, regulatory challenges and waning China demand among the shared themes in focus.

Along with Microsoft Corp., which just hit a historic $3 trillion market valuation, Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. are set to post record revenues for the quarter, underscoring the strength of the US economy. Even so, they are likely to be asked about further cost reductions after the significant job cuts they have each embarked on in recent weeks.

Apple Inc., grappling with slowing China sales, antitrust accusations and bruised from a patent fight, could give investors a better sense of early demand for its new Vision Pro, which some big-name developers are steering clear of. Boeing Co., mired deep in a safety crisis that prompted the US Federal Aviation Administration to freeze a planned production increase of 737 Max, will face more questions about how it plans to allay concerns over the quality of its aircraft.

Monday: No notable earnings.

Tuesday: Microsoft (MSFT US) is set to post a 16% jump to record quarterly sales, with TD Cowen seeing strength in its Azure segment from returning cloud customers and rising AI demand. The monetization of its AI-powered virtual assistant Copilot will be scrutinized though the product won’t make significant topline contributions until later this year, Evercore said.

Alphabet’s (GOOGL US) earnings per share is seen rising 52%, with Jefferies pointing to ad revenue growth in the year-end quarter and the ramping up of NFL Sunday Ticket channel on YouTube as driving forces. Its Google Cloud segment should see “measured and gradual” growth as customers prepare for AI deployments, Jefferies added. Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD US) AI exposure will help drive sales 9.5% higher, in contrast to Qualcomm (QCOM US), which is seen revealing a stagnant topline when it reports Wednesday despite a rebound in its handset and automotive segments. Starbucks’ (SBUX US) North American same-store sales growth is projected to about halve to 5.8% from the same period a year ago. Domestic sales were volatile in November and December amid union walkouts and social-media calls to boycott the coffee chain over its perceived response to the Israel-Hamas war, William Blair noted. General Motors (GM US) deliveries were flat in the quarter as strikes cut output at four plants that make the automaker’s top-selling models. Despite the dropoff — deliveries were up 41% the same period a year ago — profit could still beat expectations as US production likely outpaced sales to account for lost output during the strike, Bloomberg Intelligence said. UPS (UPS US) adjusted earnings per share will slide by double-digits for the fourth quarter in a row, weighed down by higher costs from its new labor contract and tepid shipping growth. Investors will want to gauge the firm’s progress on winning back market share lost during fraught labor talks and hear about the impact of Red Sea shipping disruptions.

Story continues

Wednesday: Boeing (BA US) will see operating profit of $287 million, snapping a five-quarter streak of losses on more commercial-aircraft deliveries and strong services demand. With its growth ambitions dented by the US Federal Aviation Administration’s move to freeze planned production increases for the 737 Max aircraft, executives are set to face intense scrutiny on the company’s next steps.

Mastercard (MA US) should be able to raise earnings per share by 16% for the quarter as cuts to expenses offset slowing revenue growth and increased buybacks. Company guidance for 2024 should be in line with consensus, Baird said.

Thursday: Apple (AAPL US) may score a modest beat on earnings estimates despite slowing sales in China, Evercore said, noting that a patent dispute involving its smartwatches should have little impact. Initial signs point to strong demand for the Vision Pro headset which, along with AI-driven features on its iPhones, could drive growth this year, Bank of America said. Investors will want more color on its overhaul of its App Store and iPhone features in the European Union to appease regulators..

Meta’s (META US) 2023 ad revenue growth was fueled by Chinese e-commerce platforms but whether the Facebook parent can rely on the likes of Shein and Temu this year remains to be seen, given simmering China-US tensions, BI said. Meta may also need to focus investments in its large-language model to improve ad targeting amid declining user engagement. Amazon (AMZN US) may beat expectations for a low-double-digit revenue gain — consensus calls for 11% — given a stronger-than-expected holiday season and sequentially improving sales at Amazon Web Services, BI said. The addition of ads to its Prime video service, along with its cloud order book and insights on consumer shopping trends, will be in focus.

Friday: Exxon Mobil (XOM US) has warned of a $2.5 billion writedown in some of its California operations in guidance released this month. Gas trading and downstream-derivative tailwinds shored up its profits, TD Cowen said, though consensus estimates point to a 35% fall in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have also dragged Chevron’s (CVX US) profits lower as earnings per share is seen retreating 21% with an LNG pricing uptick failing to offset lower refining margins.

Charter Communications (CHTR US) investors may focus on broadband subscriber numbers after its fight with Walt Disney over fees left its pay-TV customers temporarily unable to view channels backed by the entertainment giant. Broadband revenue could still get a boost from better average revenue per user gains with the end of promotional discounts, BI said. Cigna’s (CI US) earnings per share likely jumped 32%, more than double the previous quarter’s rate, amid a rise in medical customers and a largely stable medical loss ratio. Medical costs, forecast 14% higher in the quarter, is a concern, especially after health insurance peer Humana’s recent move to cut its forecast on higher-than-anticipated expenses.

2024-01-26T15:00:00+00:00,Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) Seeks FDA Nod for Next-Gen da Vinci 5,"Intuitive Surgical ISRG announced that it has submitted an application for FDA 510(k) clearance of its next-generation da Vinci 5 multiport surgical robot.

The company’s da Vinci robotic surgical system family will include the new da Vinci 5, as well as the X and Xi systems with multiple ports and the SP system with one port. It also has Ion, a robotic-assisted device for lung biopsy with minimal invasion. The addition of the next-generation da Vinci 5 will be a significant addition to its portfolio.

The company expects an approval soon, which will be followed by a launch later this year.

More on the News

On its fourth-quarter earnings call, Intuitive Surgical announced that it has successfully completed a thorough IDE trial for the da Vinci 5 in multiple centers, according to Guthart. The trial enrolled patients until May 2023, and ISRG applied for 510(k) approval in August 2023. The company is currently answering FDA’s queries. In addition, Intuitive Surgical is also discussing the approval pathway for da Vinci 5 with regulators in Japan and South Korea.

Investors have been eagerly waiting for ISRG’s new da Vinci system. The company's shares lost a year ago as there was no announcement of any new multiport system in 2023.

Intuitive Surgical is preparing to manufacture da Vinci 5. The company has moved X system production to its Atlanta hub. Xi system production will also go to Atlanta this year. The company said it will open new plants in California for da Vinci 5 and Ion in the next 18 months. It will also finish moving Ion and SP lines to Mexicali, Mexico.

Comparison With Peers

Another company from the same industry, Masimo MASI, won a favorable court ruling in its intellectual property dispute with tech-titan, Apple AAPL over blood oxygen sensors in newer Apple Watch models.

Per the latest ruling in the ongoing patent dispute litigation, Apple has to stop selling watches with the oxygen measurement feature while an appeal of the ban plays out. Masimo sued Apple in 2020 when the latter added a blood oxygen sensor to its watches, starting with Series 6. Following a three-year-long battle, Masimo received its first favorable ruling against Apple.

DexCom DXCM, another company in the same industry, unveiled its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Athenry. With the ability to produce millions of Dexcom rtCGM sensors annually, the new plant will contribute to the betterment of diabetes patients throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Dexcom's first manufacturing plant in Europe will guarantee product flow throughout EMEA, potentially reducing goods costs and improving sustainability by cutting down on transit delivery times.

Factors to Consider

Steady demand for EA’s digital and live services across its portfolio is expected to have aided active user growth in the fiscal third quarter.

In the to-be-reported quarter, Electronic Arts announced the release of EA SPORTS NHL 24, the latest installment of the hockey game. EA also launched EA SPORTS WRC, the official game of the FIA World Rally Championship.

EA SPORTS UFC 5, the latest game of the martial arts franchise, was also released in the to-be-reported quarter.

Moreover, an increase in active users after the release of blockbuster games like EA SPORTS FIFA and Apex Legends is expected to have boosted net bookings growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Apex Legends Season 18 drove greater-than-anticipated player acquisition and monetization in the fiscal second quarter. The momentum is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter.

On Oct 6, EA announced strong engagement of players in its EA SPORTS FC ecosystem, including both EA SPORTS FC 24 and EA SPORTS FC Mobile, in the first week after its launch.

Net bookings for the fiscal second quarter were $1.82 billion, up 3.8% year over year or 5% in constant currency.

The company expects net bookings between $2.25 billion and $2.45 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2024. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for bookings is currently pegged at $2.383 billion, indicating a rise of 1.8% year over year.

EA's strength in Live Services in mobile game franchises, such as Battlefield 2042, It Takes Two, Madden Mobile, FIFA Mobile, Tetris, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is expected to have positively impacted the top line.

In the to-be-reported quarter, EA announced the launch of EA SPORTS FC Tactical, a new mobile game that focuses on turn-based strategy.

However, the company has been witnessing increased operating expenses for game development and marketing. The rising expenses are expected to have kept margins under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.

Sluggishness in video game spending in the quarter is expected to have reflected in EA’s top-line growth. Per VentureBeat, which cited NPD data on consumer spending on video games, video game spending declined 5% in October and 7% in November. For the month of December, video game sales remained mostly even, with a slight 4% increase in total sales.
